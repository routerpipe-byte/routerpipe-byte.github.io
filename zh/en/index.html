📚 School Hours and Tuition Differences Spanish Public Schools: School hours are from 9:00–14:00, with 4 classes per day, and are free of charge. Spanish Private and International Schools: School hours are typically from 9:00–16:00, with 6 classes per day. The median tuition for private schools is approximately €6,000/year (about 50,000 RMB). International schools cost around €8,000/year (about 70,000 RMB). There are significant variations based on grade level, region, and school, with costs potentially differing by 1-2 times. 🏫 Teaching Staff and Pedagogical Features Teacher absenteeism is relatively high in Spain. A doctor’s note for sick leave has legal force and can be issued over the phone for paid sick leave. Primary schools generally use a “generalist” system, where a single teacher teaches multiple subjects like English, math, humanities, science, art, and physical education, limiting subject-specific expertise. Subject-specific teaching only begins in middle school. The saying “the gym teacher taught my math” is not a joke in Spain but a result of the generalist system in primary schools. Exam scores are not ranked. 🈯 Language of Instruction and Multilingual Environment International schools primarily use English for instruction; Private and public schools mainly use Spanish; Autonomous communities like Valencia and Catalonia require the study of local languages; In middle school, a second foreign language such as French or German is added, making the multilingual workload heavy. 📖 Workload and Holiday Schedule There is less homework after school. The academic year is divided into three terms, with a total of about 160–180 teaching days. Holidays are long. 🇨🇳 Comparison with Basic Education in China Public Schools: School hours are from 8:00–16:00, with 6–8 classes per day, free of charge, with some regions offering after-school extension classes. Private/International Schools: 8:00–17:30, with evening self-study sessions starting in middle school, which do not exist in Spain. Private: Approximately 60,000 RMB/year International: Approximately 180,000 RMB/year The academic year is divided into two semesters, with more than 190 teaching days. 🏟️ Disparity in Campus Facilities International schools in China often have campuses of over 100 acres, featuring heated swimming pools, theaters, multimedia libraries, maker labs, Olympic-standard stadiums, and even equestrian fields, golf courses, and drone and robotics labs. In contrast, Spanish schools are modest and compact, with simple facilities. 📘 Curriculum and Difficulty Many people believe that primary school math in China is much more difficult than abroad, but this is a long-standing misconception.

In Chinese culture, turtles and tortoises are seen as symbols of longevity, as if they are naturally born to outlive several human generations.
But here’s the question: Are there really any ‘soft-shelled turtles’ that have lived for a thousand years?
Many people, upon seeing a massive tortoise or turtle, will blurt out, “Wow, this one must be hundreds of years old!” Such claims might “sound reasonable,” but in reality, they don’t stand up to the slightest scrutiny.

Many people subconsciously assume:
Since Europe is the successor to Ancient Greece and Rome, then mathematics, philosophy, and science should have been naturally passed down through Europe.
