The answer lies not only in ideas themselves, but also in geography.\nThe natural structure of the Mediterranean—fragmented peninsulas, rolling mountains, crisscrossing river valleys, and long, winding coastlines—naturally shaped multiple, relatively independent political and economic centers.\nIn such an environment:\nPower was difficult to centralize for long periods. Cities possessed broad autonomy. Multi-centric competition became the norm. The republic was precisely the political form best suited to this environment.\nIn Athens, the democratic reforms beginning in 508 BC first systematically introduced a subversive idea:\nPolitics could be the public affairs of citizens, not the private property of a ruler.\nAthenian democracy certainly had strict boundaries for participation, but its historical significance lies not in “whether it was sufficiently equal,” but in the fact that it clearly demonstrated for the first time:\nDecisions could be made collectively. Power could be rotated, not inherited. Public affairs could exist independently of any individual. Once this idea emerged, it became an indelible source in European political thought.\nThe republic did not only exist in small city-states If Athens proved that “a republic is possible,” then the Roman Republic further proved that:\nA republic could not only exist, but could also function in a large state over the long term.\nFrom 509 BC to 27 BC, the Roman Republic lasted for nearly five centuries.\nThe Romans used one term to define the state:\nRes Publica — public affairs.\nThis meant:\nThe state was not the property of any single family. Power was deliberately divided and mutually checked. The law was above any individual. Even after Rome entered its imperial era, the Senate, the legal system, and urban autonomy did not disappear. The republic was preserved in institutions and memory, becoming an important political resource for later generations to continually look back to.\nThe Middle Ages were not a blank period for republicanism Many people assume that only feudal monarchies remained in medieval Europe, but the opposite is true.\nIn regions where commerce, shipping, and cities were highly developed, the republic did not disappear but rather shifted into the cities, continuing to exist in another form.\nThe most famous example is the Republic of Venice.\nFrom 697 to 1797, this kingless republic existed for a full 1100 years. The Doge held a lifetime appointment but was strictly constrained by layers of councils and institutions, with the entire political design revolving around a single goal:\nTo prevent any single individual from controlling the state.\nCoexisting with Venice was a series of other Italian city-state republics:\nRepublic of Florence (1115–1532) Republic of Genoa (1005–1797) Republic of Pisa (11th–13th centuries) Their fates varied, but they shared a clear commonality: In Europe, monarchy was never the only political option.\nWhen the republic moved into the world of commerce Outside of Italy, the republican spirit also spread along another path—commerce.\nThe Hanseatic League, active from the 13th to the 16th centuries, was not a state but a confederation of autonomous cities.\nIts core members were a group of free cities without hereditary monarchs:\nLübeck (the de facto leader) Hamburg, Bremen Riga, Tallinn Danzig (Gdańsk) Stockholm, etc. These cities organized power and order through councils, contracts, and negotiation, demonstrating an important republican experience:\nA state does not necessarily depend on royal authority to be sustained; rules, credit, and negotiation can also form a stable order.\nThis experience profoundly influenced the later free city system and the tradition of commercial law, also becoming an early prototype for the organizational logic of modern economic communities.\nFrom Europe to America, and back to Europe By the 18th century, these republican experiences, scattered across Europe, were systematically integrated for the first time.\nAmerica did not create its republican system out of thin air; rather, it drew mature nourishment from European history:\nRome’s republican language and checks on power The autonomous experience of European city-states Britain’s parliamentary tradition The Enlightenment-era concepts of rule of law and rights America’s innovation was to write these experiences into a formal constitution, making the republic a replicable and sustainable system for a nation-state.\nAnd this modern republican model, already proven in practice, soon crossed the Atlantic again to influence the European continent.\nThe French Revolution: The modern crystallization of Europe’s republican tradition In 1792, the French Republic was established.\nFrance was not Europe’s first republic, but it was the first modern European polity to explicitly establish the ‘republic’ as the sole source of the state’s legitimacy.\nThis transformation did not occur in isolation.\nLafayette, having personally participated in the American Revolutionary War, brought practical republican experience back to France;\nThomas Jefferson, as the U.S. ambassador to France, was deeply involved in the intellectual exchange of the French Revolution;\nThe language concerning rights, sovereignty, and law in France’s Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, is, in spirit, highly homologous with the American Revolution.\nDuring the revolution, the Jacobins advanced republican practice with the core ideals of popular sovereignty and citizen rights. However, in the real-world environment of war and mounting internal and external pressures, their political practice gradually turned to using terror to maintain order.\nFrance subsequently experienced Napoleon’s rise as emperor, the restoration of the monarchy, and a return to republicanism, until the late 19th century, when the republic finally stabilized as the nation’s fundamental form of government.\nConclusion European democracy is not an accidental flash in history, but the result of over two thousand years of repeated practice, sedimentation, and selection.\n","wordCount":"1020","inLanguage":"zh","datePublished":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","dateModified":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"/en/why-did-europe-move-towards-democracy-the-republican-tradition-not-an-accidental-historical-choice/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"zixia","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=/zh/ accesskey=h title="zixia (Alt + H)">zixia</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
