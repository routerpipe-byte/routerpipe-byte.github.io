Bronze Age: Indo-European Steppe Peoples Enter Europe (c. 3000 BCE)\nSource Pontic-Caspian Steppe (Yamnaya culture-related peoples)\nPaternal Genetic Signature R1a, R1b\nElements Introduced\nHorses and chariots Military aristocratic structure Patrilineal inheritance system Indo-European languages Result\nSignificant replacement of the male-dominant stratum in most parts of Europe The European linguistic system shifted wholesale to Indo-European. III. Language Replacement: The Separation of Civilizational Structure and Linguistic Origin The urban structures, institutions, and cultural traditions of Greek and Roman civilizations continued the foundation of the Neolithic Mediterranean-Near Eastern civilization, primarily established by early agricultural populations.\nBut their language systems were:\nGreek → Indo-European language family Latin → Indo-European language family Concluding Fact Early agricultural populations laid the foundation for civilization and urban structures, but under the subsequent military and political systems dominated by Indo-European steppe peoples, a systematic Indo-Europeanization occurred at the linguistic level.\nIV. Iron Age: The Celts Dominate Western Europe (c. 800–100 BCE)\nPaternal Genetic Signature Predominantly R1b\nLanguage Indo-European family · Celtic branch\nDistribution Area\nGaul (modern France) British Isles Belgium Northern Italy Northern Iberian Peninsula Social Form Tribal confederation structure, did not form a unified empire.\nV. Roman Period: Latinization and Integration (c. 100 BCE–400 CE)\nRoman Republic → Roman Empire Latin became the lingua franca of Western Europe Local Celts and other groups were culturally and linguistically Latinized Characteristics Rome’s integration was primarily institutional, legal, and cultural; it did not involve large-scale, systematic population replacement.\nVI. The Rise of the Germanic Peoples (3rd–6th centuries CE)\nEthnic Characteristics The Germanic peoples also belong to the Indo-European system, with paternal genetics dominated by Haplogroup R1, mixed with some original Northern European Haplogroup I components.\nMajor Branches\nOstrogoths Visigoths Franks Anglo-Saxons Norse Vikings Key Events\n476 CE: Germanic mercenaries depose the Western Roman Emperor Fall of the Western Roman Empire Subsequently, Western Europe gradually formed a political structure with Germanic nobility as the core of secular rule and the Church as the spiritual authority, eventually developing into the Holy Roman Empire system.\nVII. The Ethnogenesis and Linguistic Formation of England (Timeline) 410 CE: Roman legions withdraw from Britain\nMid-5th century CE (c. 450 onwards): Angles, Saxons, and Jutes enter Britain\nResult\nThe Celts were pushed to Scotland, Wales, and Ireland Language: English (Germanic family) Ethnic Structure: Germanic core + Celtic periphery VIII. The Ethnogenesis and Linguistic Formation of France (Timeline) 1st century BCE: Caesar conquers Gaul\n5th century CE: The Franks enter Gaul\nc. 481 CE: Clovis I establishes the Frankish Kingdom\nResult\nRuling Class: Germanic people (the Franks) Population Majority: Latinized Celts Language: Vulgar Latin evolves → French (Romance family) IX. Spain and Italy Spain 5th–8th centuries: Visigothic rule\n711–1492: Muslim rule in Iberia\nPopulation Composition\nNative Iberians Romans Germanic peoples North Africans Language Spanish (Romance, derived from Latin)\nItaly Core region of Roman civilization High degree of population continuity in Europe Language Italian (Romance family) X. Overview of European Regional Ethnic Structures Northern Europe: Germanic peoples (Germany, Austria, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Iceland) Western Europe: Germanic ruling class + Latin cultural majority Southern Europe: Latino-Greek civilizational system Eastern Europe: Predominantly Slavic, with mixed Turkic and Balkan components XI. The Unifying Role of Religion After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the only institution that maintained a complete, cross-regional organizational structure was the Catholic Church.\nLatin became the transnational language of religion and scholarship The Pope held the power to legitimize royal authority The religious network connected European nations and royal houses, forming a supranational integrative structure XII. Royal Marriages and Supranational Rule Represented by the House of Habsburg:\nRuled multiple countries through royal marriages The royal lineage often did not align with the local ethnic majority The concept of the nation-state primarily formed in the modern era.\nXIII. Concluding Facts Approximately 50%–60% of paternal lineages in Europe belong to Haplogroup R1 Ethnic divisions are not determined by ancestry alone But are shaped by the following factors combined:\nLanguage Historical memory Cultural traditions Political and religious structures Appendix I: Timeline of European Ethnogenesis Time Event Main Population Key Changes 7000–5000 BCE Neolithic agricultural diffusion Haplogroup J (represented by J2) Agriculture, settlement, proto-city-states 3000 BCE Arrival of Indo-European steppe peoples R1a / R1b Military aristocracy, Indo-European languages 800–100 BCE Celts dominate Western Europe R1b Main population of Western Europe 100 BCE Roman conquest of Gaul Romans + Celts Latinization 3rd–6th centuries CE Great Germanic Migrations Germanic peoples Collapse of Western Rome 476 CE Fall of the Western Roman Empire Germanic mercenaries Regime change 5th–8th centuries Gothic kingdoms Visigoths Western European monarchies 711–1492 Muslim rule in Iberia North Africans High degree of mixing Middle Ages Catholic integration of Europe Church system Supranational unity Modern Era Formation of nation-states Various peoples Solidification of national identities Appendix II: Comparison Table of Major Populations Population Paternal Genetic Signature Language System Historical Role Neolithic Farmers Represented by J2 Pre-Indo-European languages Foundation of agriculture, city-states Indo-European Steppe Peoples R1a / R1b Indo-European languages Military, ruling class Celts R1b Celtic branch Main population of Western Europe Greeks / Romans Mixed (incl.
