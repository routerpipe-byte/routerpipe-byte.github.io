Bronze Age: Indo-European Steppe Peoples Enter Europe (c. 3000 BCE)\nOrigin Pontic-Caspian Steppe (Yamnaya culture-related populations)\nPaternal Genetic Characteristics R1a, R1b\nElements Brought\nHorses and chariots Military aristocratic structure Patrilineal inheritance system Indo-European languages Results\nSignificant replacement of the male dominant layer in most parts of Europe The European linguistic system shifted entirely to Indo-European III. Language Replacement: The Separation of Civilizational Structure and Linguistic Origin The urban structure, institutions, and cultural traditions of Greek and Roman civilizations continued the Neolithic civilizational foundation of the Mediterranean-Near East, which was primarily established by early agricultural populations.\nHowever, their linguistic systems were:\nGreek → Indo-European Latin → Indo-European Concluding Fact Early agricultural populations laid the foundation for civilization and urban structures, but under the subsequent military and political systems dominated by Indo-European steppe peoples, a systematic Indo-Europeanization occurred at the linguistic level.\nIV. Iron Age: The Celts Dominate Western Europe (c. 800–100 BCE)\nPaternal Genetic Characteristics Predominantly R1b\nLanguage Indo-European · Celtic branch\nDistribution Area\nGaul (modern France) The British Isles Belgium Northern Italy Northern Iberian Peninsula Social Structure Tribal confederation structure, did not form a unified empire.\nV. Roman Period: Latinization and Integration (c. 100 BCE–400 CE)\nRoman Republic → Roman Empire Latin became the lingua franca of Western Europe Local Celtic and other groups were culturally and linguistically Latinized Characteristics Rome’s integration was primarily institutional, legal, and cultural; it did not involve large-scale, systematic population replacement.\nVI. The Rise of the Germanic Peoples (3rd–6th centuries CE)\nEthnic Characteristics The Germanic peoples also belong to the Indo-European system, with paternal genetics dominated by the R1 haplogroup, mixed with some original Northern European I haplogroup components.\nMain Branches\nOstrogoths Visigoths Franks Anglo-Saxons Norse Vikings Key Events\n476 CE: Germanic mercenaries depose the Western Roman Emperor Fall of the Western Roman Empire Subsequently, Western Europe gradually formed a political structure with the Germanic aristocracy as the secular ruling core and the Church as the spiritual authority, eventually developing into the Holy Roman Empire system.\nVII. The Ethno-linguistic Formation of England (Timeline) 410 CE: Roman legions withdraw from Britain\nMid-5th century CE (c. 450 CE onwards): Angles, Saxons, and Jutes enter Britain\nResults\nThe Celts were pushed to Scotland, Wales, and Ireland Language: English (Germanic language family) Ethnic Structure: Germanic core + Celtic periphery VIII. The Ethno-linguistic Formation of France (Timeline) 1st century BCE: Caesar conquers Gaul\n5th century CE: The Franks enter Gaul\nc. 481 CE: Clovis I establishes the Frankish Kingdom\nResults\nRuling Class: Germanic people (Franks) Population Majority: Latinized Celts Language: Evolution of Latin → French (Romance language family) IX. Spain and Italy Spain 5th–8th centuries: Visigothic rule\n711–1492: Muslim rule in Iberia\nPopulation Composition\nOriginal Iberians Romans Germanic peoples North Africans Language Spanish (Romance, derived from Latin)\nItaly Core area of Roman civilization Population continuity is relatively high in Europe Language Italian (Romance language family) X. Overview of European Regional Ethnic Structures Northern Europe: Germanic peoples (Germany, Austria, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Iceland) Western Europe: Germanic ruling class + Latin cultural majority Southern Europe: Latino-Greek civilizational system Eastern Europe: Predominantly Slavic, with mixed Turkic and Balkan components XI. The Unifying Role of Religion After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the only organization that maintained a complete, cross-regional structure was the Catholic Church.\nLatin became the cross-ethnic language of religion and scholarship The Pope held the power to certify the legitimacy of royal authority The religious network connected European countries and royal families, forming a supranational integration structure. XII. Royal Marriages and Supranational Rule Represented by the House of Habsburg:\nRuled multiple countries through royal marriages Royal lineage often did not align with the local ethnic majority The concept of the nation-state primarily formed in the modern era.\nXIII. Concluding Facts Approximately 50%–60% of European paternal genetics belong to the R1 haplogroup Ethnic divisions are not determined by ancestry alone Instead, they are shaped by a combination of the following factors:\nLanguage Historical memory Cultural traditions Political and religious structures Appendix I: Timeline of European Ethnogenesis Time Event Main Population Key Change 7000–5000 BCE Neolithic agricultural diffusion J haplogroup (represented by J2) Agriculture, settlement, proto-city-states 3000 BCE Indo-European steppe peoples enter R1a / R1b Military aristocracy, Indo-European languages 800–100 BCE Celts dominate Western Europe R1b Main population of Western Europe 100 BCE Roman conquest of Gaul Romans + Celts Latinization 3rd–6th centuries CE Great Germanic Migrations Germanic peoples Collapse of Western Rome 476 CE Fall of the Western Roman Empire Germanic mercenaries Regime change 5th–8th centuries Gothic kingdoms Visigoths Western European monarchies 711–1492 Muslim rule in Iberia North Africans High degree of mixing Middle Ages Catholic Church integrates Europe Church system Supranational unity Modern Era Formation of nation-states Various ethnic groups Solidification of national identities Appendix II: Comparison of Major Populations Population Paternal Genetic Characteristics Linguistic System Historical Role Neolithic Farmers Represented by J2 Pre-Indo-European languages Agriculture, foundation of city-states Indo-European Steppe Peoples R1a / R1b Indo-European Military, ruling class Celts R1b Celtic branch Main population of Western Europe Greeks / Romans Mixed (incl.
