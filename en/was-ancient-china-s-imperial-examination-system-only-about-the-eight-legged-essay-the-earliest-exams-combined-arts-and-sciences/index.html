For a long time, the true imperial examination system was a “dual cultivation of arts and sciences.” Ancient China was not only a nation of poetry, literature, rites, and music but also a civilization that revered science and rationality.\n📖 I. The Origin of the Imperial Examinations: Giving Every Humble Scholar a Chance Emperor Yang of Sui initiated the imperial examination system, and the Tang Dynasty perfected it. This system broke the monopoly of aristocratic clans, allowing commoners to enter officialdom based on knowledge. It was the world’s earliest “meritocratic system for talent.”\nThe Tang Dynasty’s imperial exams not only tested for “Jinshi” (Advanced Scholars) but also included STEM subjects like “Mathematics” and “Ming Suan” (Computational Studies):\nGeometric surveying Hydraulic engineering design Architectural proportions Astronomy and calendrical science The ability of Monk Tang and his companions to accurately predict a solar eclipse was not a miracle, but science. The study of science and engineering was a crucial criterion for selecting officials at the time.\n📚 II. The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art: The Foundation of the Han People’s Rational Tradition In the first century BCE, the Chinese had already written The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art. This book could solve systems of equations, measure slopes, and calculate embankments, making it the world’s earliest great work on applied mathematics.\nOne problem from the book:\n“There are three types of grain, with different prices and different weights. When mixed and sold, a certain amount of money is obtained. What is the price of each type of grain?” This is the prototype of a system of three linear equations with three variables.\nAt that time, Europe was still using Roman numerals and had not even developed the concept of “zero.” This book later became the core textbook for the “Mathematics” subject in the Sui and Tang dynasties’ examinations, reflecting the fundamental spirit of the Han people: “trust in reason, and apply the arts.”\n🧮 III. STEM Examination Questions: As Difficult as Modern Engineering The examination questions for “Mathematics Juren” (Provincial Graduates in Mathematics) in the Song Dynasty were extremely difficult. For example:\n“If a canal is divided into three branches, each drawing a different amount of water, how high should the weirs be built to make the water flow evenly?”\nThis already involved fluid dynamics and geometric calculations. At that time, “Doctors of Mathematics” and officials of the “Directorate for Waterways” were in charge of engineering and surveying. Passing this kind of “STEM Juren” exam was equivalent to being a “national engineer” today.\nIn that era, being an official required not only writing poetry but also understanding architecture and algorithms. Rationality, practicality, and science were part of the government system.\n⛪ IV. The Divergence of Reason and Faith: The Different Paths of the Han People and Europe Meanwhile, Europe was mired in the “Dark Ages” under religious rule. The Church declared:\n“The Earth is the center of the universe. To question this is heresy.”\nBruno was burned at the stake, Copernicus was imprisoned, and Galileo was forced to recant. Reason and science were burned to ashes by the fire of faith.\nChina, on the other hand, used the “imperial examinations” to stimulate reason and “scholarship” to replace faith. One used religion to control thought; the other used examinations to reward intellect. These two paths determined the trajectories of two different civilizations.\n☪️ V. A Backward Europe, An Open Islamic World While medieval Europe was shackled by religion, the Islamic world was at the zenith of its civilization.\nBaghdad’s “House of Wisdom” gathered scholars from Greece, Persia, and India, catalyzing leaps in algebra, astronomy, medicine, and chemistry. “Arabic numerals” and chemical terms with the “al-” prefix all originated from here.\nAt that time, Muslim women were not forced to cover their heads, whereas the Christian world required women to veil their faces and forbade them from learning. In that era, Islam was more open, and Christianity was more conservative.\nThe key to civilization is not the name of the religion, but whether it respects reason.\n🎨 VI. The Renaissance: The Rebirth of Reason, Europe’s Comeback In the 16th century, Luther’s Reformation tore apart the shackles of theocracy, and the liberation of thought brought about the Renaissance and the Scientific Revolution.\nDa Vinci, Copernicus, Galileo, Newton… Humanity progressed from geocentrism to understanding the cosmos, from alchemy to chemistry, from faith to science. The Renaissance forged Europe’s future leadership in science and technology.\n⚙️ VII. China’s Decline: The Interruption of the STEM Tradition The wars of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period destroyed the education system; Although the Song Dynasty retained the mathematics subject, its status declined; The Yuan Dynasty abolished STEM examinations for the Han people; The Ming Dynasty replaced practical studies with the eight-legged essay—reason became shackled by literary formalism. From then on, China’s science and technology ceased to develop systematically. Craftsmanship remained at the level of “shu” (technique), having lost its “dao” (way/principle). As Europe sailed toward the Age of Discovery and the Industrial Revolution, we stalled on the eve of our own “Tiangong Kaiwu.”\n☯️ VIII. The Underlying Belief of the Han People: Respect Spirits but Keep Them at a Distance (Transition: Why the Han people are naturally endowed with a rational gene)\nTo understand why China was able to embark on the path of reason and science so early, we must return to the source of its thought—the belief structure of the Han people.\nKing Wen of Zhou forbade the “disorderly worship of ghosts and spirits,” and Confucius went further, saying, “Respect ghosts and spirits, but keep them at a distance.” This is not just a principle of ritual propriety but a declaration of spiritual independence.\nThe Han people worship their ancestors, not deities; Yuchi Jingde became a door god, Guan Yu the God of War, and Mazu the protector of seafarers— they are all “moralized” and “personified” gods, not religious creations.\nThis cultural DNA proves: The Han people are inherently endowed with the brilliance of rationality, unconstrained by religious dogma. They believe in patterns, value practice, and are better suited than any other people to follow the path of science.\nThis is why China was able to write The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art in the BCE era, establish STEM-based imperial examinations in the Sui and Tang dynasties, and invent gunpowder, the compass, the waterwheel, and printing in the Song Dynasty. Rationality has always been the hidden source code of Han civilization.\n🕯️ IX. Conclusion: Rationality is the Nation’s True Faith From the rational rituals of King Wen of Zhou to the STEM-based imperial examinations of the Sui and Tang; From the scientific spirit of The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art to the belief of “respecting spirits but keeping them at a distance”; The fundamental color of Han civilization has always been rationality.\nUnfortunately, this spark was once obscured by the shadows of war and power. But reason was never extinguished— it still flickers in every heart that seeks truth and harbors doubt.\nTrue faith is not gazing at the heavens, but planting one’s feet firmly on the ground.\nWhen we once again pick up the torch of reason and science, perhaps we can, once more, become the guides of human civilization.\nan encyclopedia of craftsmanship\n","wordCount":"1281","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","dateModified":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"/en/was-ancient-china-s-imperial-examination-system-only-about-the-eight-legged-essay-the-earliest-exams-combined-arts-and-sciences/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"zixia","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=/en/ accesskey=h title="zixia (Alt + H)">zixia</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
