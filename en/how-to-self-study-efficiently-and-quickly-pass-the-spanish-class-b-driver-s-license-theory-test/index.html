Theory Knowledge Study Method

Directly cramming with practice questions is highly discouraged because:

The question bank is vast. The English version has over 200 sets, each with 30 questions, totaling more than 6,000 questions. Completing them all is time-consuming and exhausting.
The translations and questions in the bank may not be accurate, and the answers could be incorrect.
The actual exam questions are not taken directly from the question bank, so finishing it is not a guarantee of success.
The knowledge in the question bank is fragmented and unsystematic. Without systematic learning, you might be unable to answer if a question is phrased differently.


Efficient Study Method: Since I took the exam in English, the following information is based on English materials."><meta name=author content><link rel=canonical href=/en/how-to-self-study-efficiently-and-quickly-pass-the-spanish-class-b-driver-s-license-theory-test/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.da3211e5ef867bf2b75fd5a6515cfed7195c011e8ab735694e203810a827097b.css integrity="sha256-2jIR5e+Ge/K3X9WmUVz+1xlcAR6KtzVpTiA4EKgnCXs=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=zh href=/zh/ru-he-gao-xiao-zi-xue-kuai-su-tong-guo-xi-ban-ya-qi-che-jia-shi-zhi-zhao-b-de-li-lun-kao-shi/><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=/en/how-to-self-study-efficiently-and-quickly-pass-the-spanish-class-b-driver-s-license-theory-test/><link rel=alternate hreflang=es href=/es/como-estudiar-de-forma-autodidacta-y-eficiente-para-aprobar-rapidamente-el-examen-teorico-del-permiso-de-conducir-b/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51);color-scheme:dark}.list{background:var(--theme)}.toc{background:var(--entry)}}@media(prefers-color-scheme:light){.list::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--code-bg)}}</style></noscript><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="dark":localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="light":window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches?document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="dark":document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="light"</script><meta property="og:url" content="/en/how-to-self-study-efficiently-and-quickly-pass-the-spanish-class-b-driver-s-license-theory-test/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="zixia"><meta property="og:title" content="How to Self-Study Efficiently and Quickly Pass the Spanish Class B Driver's License Theory Test"><meta property="og:description" content="I.

The actual exam questions are not taken directly from the question bank, so finishing it is not a guarantee of success. The knowledge in the question bank is fragmented and unsystematic. Without systematic learning, you might be unable to answer if a question is phrased differently. Efficient Study Method: Since I took the exam in English, the following information is based on English materials.\nStart with condensed content from the textbook: https://practicatest.com/en/book-theory-driving-test. The information on this webpage is very concise and can be reviewed in about 4 hours. However, it lacks content on new energy vehicles, environmental labels, electronic motorcycle helmets, and electric scooters, which you’ll need to study from the textbook. Complete Theory Textbook: Most textbooks are over 200 pages long, containing a lot of content, which can be time-consuming and tiring to study. It’s recommended to supplement your learning by focusing on your weak areas while doing practice questions. If you have time, you can skim through the entire textbook. Digital versions of the English textbook are circulated privately, but due to copyright issues, I can only provide keywords for you to search on your own. You can also buy a physical copy on Amazon. Keywords: “Manual Permiso B inglés”. Online digital English textbook: https://fliphtml5.com/lptj/szub/basic/51-100 Popular Question Banks Popular options include Practicatest, AEOL, and Todotest, all available for online purchase. Taking AEOL as an example: Purchase Link: https://www.autoescueladummy.com/product-page/plan-premium Online Question Bank Link: https://cloud.aeolservice.es/ It costs 10 euros per month. You need to enter your NIE number to link your account upon purchase. To renew after expiration, you can make another purchase and enter the same NIE number to extend your account. AEOL Question Bank Usage Recommendations: Choose the 744 question bank and start with the last few sets of questions. The bank is not randomly arranged; the earlier sets contain older content, while the newer topics are in the later sets. The latest topics (such as vehicle environmental labels, electronic motorcycle helmets, new energy vehicles, electric scooters, etc.) may only appear in the last few new test sets. Older textbooks may also not cover these topics, so supplementary study is required. Tips for Practice Questions: It’s not necessary to complete all the questions in the bank, as there are too many, and the actual exam questions are not identical to those in the bank. The actual exam consists of 30 questions to be completed in 30 minutes, with a maximum of 3 incorrect answers allowed. When your accuracy on practice questions reaches over 90%, your chances of passing the exam are very high. The AEOL question bank records your incorrect answers. Use the incorrect answer test feature to review and reinforce your knowledge before the exam. Free Mock Tests from the DGT: The DGT’s official website provides 3 free English mock tests for practice: https://sedeapl.dgt.gob.es:7443/WEB_AUTO-6/examen/Instrucciones.jsf\nII. DIY Online Registration Booking an Appointment for the Theory Test Book an appointment on the official website: https://sede.dgt.gob.es/es/otros-tramites/cita-previa-jefaturas/index.shtml Click on “Solicitud de cita previa” and follow the prompts to book. Note: This is to book an appointment to go to the DGT office to apply for the exam, not to book the exam date itself. Don’t worry if there are no available slots. They are usually released on weekdays at 2 PM. You will definitely get an appointment if you check for a few days. Medical Examination for Driving Test: List of medical centers: https://www.dgt.es/conoce-la-dgt/con-quien-trabajamos/centros-reconocimiento-conductores/ Just choose the one closest to you. Medical Examination Content: Inquiry about medical history; Concentration test (includes mini-games): A ball passes through an opaque box. You must judge the time it takes for the ball to pass through based on its speed and the distance to the sides of the box, then press a pause button. Separately control two cars with your left and right hands, driving them on two different tracks while avoiding hitting the edges; Vision test. Note: After the examination, double-check the information on the report (NIE number, name, date of birth, address, phone number, date of examination, etc.). The medical report is valid for 3 months, so be sure to check the date of the examination. The fee is around 30 euros, and you need to bring your NIE card. Exam Fee Payment: Payment Website: https://sede.dgt.gob.es/es/otros-tramites/compra-y-actualizacion-de-tasas/ You can also directly access the payment form: https://sedeclave.dgt.gob.es/WEB_Tasas7/jsp/tasas/generarPresupuesto.jspx On the form, select “791-2.1”.
