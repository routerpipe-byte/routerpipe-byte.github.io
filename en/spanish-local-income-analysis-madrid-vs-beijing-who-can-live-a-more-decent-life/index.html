One commenter asked, “Why not compare the income of Spanish locals? For them, these prices are nothing.”\nAlright, let’s complete the picture today: What are the income levels in Madrid and Beijing really like? We’ll cover high-income earners, blue-collar workers, and post-tax disposable income all in one go.\nI. Post-Tax Income is the Real Purchasing Power To measure the standard of living in a place, you can’t just look at gross salary. Post-tax disposable income (the actual income after deducting personal income tax, social security, etc.) is what truly reflects a resident’s living capacity.\n📌 Why Compare Post-Tax Income? High tax burdens are a real expense. Due to banking transparency, all income in Spain is subject to taxation, ranging from approximately 19% to 47% or even higher. Cash transactions are restricted. Financial transparency means single cash transactions cannot exceed €1,000, or they are considered illegal. All Spanish banks are connected to the tax authorities. Whether it’s a transfer between individuals or a payment from a company to an individual, if the amount is large or the frequency is unusual, the bank is obligated to ask the recipient for the reason for the transaction and relevant tax payment proof. If a reasonable and legal justification cannot be provided, the account is highly likely to be frozen. II. Madrid vs. Beijing: Per Capita Post-Tax Income Comparison 🇪🇸 Madrid Post-Tax Monthly Salary (2024, Instarem data): Approx. €2,174 Annual Income: €2,174 × 12 = €26,088 Equivalent in RMB: Approx. ¥203,486 (at 1€ ≈ 7.8 RMB) ⚠ Note: This is the average post-tax salary for ‘full-time salaried workers’ and is not equivalent to ‘per capita disposable income’ (which also includes income from property, transfer payments, etc.). Due to a lack of official statistics, we use post-tax salary as a basis for estimation here.\n🇨🇳 Beijing Per Capita Disposable Income of All Residents (2024): ¥85,415 Per Capita Disposable Income of Urban Residents: ¥92,464 ✅ This data comes from the National Bureau of Statistics of China and is already a ‘post-tax’ figure, covering all residents (regardless of profession).\n📊 Preliminary Conclusion In terms of post-tax income: Madrid’s is approximately 2.2 times that of Beijing. But this is just an average. For a true comparison, we need to look at it by profession. III. High-Tech Talent Comparison: Beijing Has the Edge Although Spain’s average salary seems higher, once we break it down by specific industries, especially for high-tech talent, Beijing’s competitiveness immediately becomes apparent.\n👩‍🏫 1. University Lecturer Region Gross Annual Salary Post-Tax Estimate Equivalent in RMB Madrid €35,000–45,000 €28,000–36,000 ¥218,400–281,000 Beijing ¥200,000–350,000 Already post-tax ¥200,000–350,000 ✅ Summary: Incomes at top Beijing universities already surpass Madrid’s, and the average level is roughly on par.\n⚖ 2. Law Firm Partner Region Gross Annual Salary Post-Tax Estimate Equivalent in RMB Madrid €80,000–150,000+ €60,000–90,000 ¥470k–700k Beijing ¥500k–3M+ Varies ¥500k and up ✅ Summary: The income gap in mid-to-large law firms is huge. Beijing has a high ceiling, while Madrid is more stable but harder to break through.\n🏥 3. Attending Physician (Public Hospital) Region Gross Annual Salary Post-Tax Estimate Equivalent in RMB Madrid €50,000–70,000 €35,000–49,000 ¥273,000–383,000 Beijing ¥250,000–400,000 Already post-tax ¥250,000–400,000 ✅ Summary: Incomes are similar in both cities. Beijing doctors’ actual income is likely higher due to project commissions and position allowances.\n💻 4. Senior Software Engineer Region Gross Annual Salary Post-Tax Estimate Equivalent in RMB Madrid €45,000–65,000 €31,500–45,500 ¥245,700–354,900 Beijing ¥300,000–600,000 Already post-tax ¥300,000–600,000 ✅ Summary: In the internet industry, Beijing is far ahead. Tech positions in Spain tend to have a ‘salary cap’.\n📌 Summary In high-tech fields like education, healthcare, IT, and law, Beijing’s post-tax income is basically on par with or even higher than Madrid’s. Especially in the internet industry, Beijing’s income offers greater growth potential and flexibility.\nIV. Blue-Collar Group Comparison: More Dignified in Madrid, More Frugal in Beijing 👷 Construction Worker Madrid Post-Tax Annual Salary: €15,000–20,000 ≈ ¥117,000–156,000 Beijing Post-Tax Annual Salary: ¥60,000–96,000 🔌 Plumber/Electrician Madrid Post-Tax Annual Salary: €18,000–25,000 ≈ ¥141,000–196,000 Beijing Post-Tax Annual Salary: ¥72,000–108,000 🛵 Delivery Driver Madrid Post-Tax Annual Salary: €12,000–18,000 ≈ ¥93,000–140,000 Beijing Post-Tax Annual Salary: ¥72,000–120,000 🛍 Salesperson / Cashier Madrid Post-Tax Annual Salary: €11,000–16,000 ≈ ¥86,000–125,000 Beijing Post-Tax Annual Salary: ¥48,000–84,000 ✅ Summary: For blue-collar jobs, Madrid’s income is generally higher. Spain has a strong labor protection system, a high minimum wage, and compliant employment practices, making it more ‘dignified’ overall.\nV. Differences in Cost of Living and Convenience 💸 Where is Madrid’s Cost of Living High? The previous article, 《The Downsides of Living in Spain: A Detailed 2024 Comparison of Madrid vs. Beijing》, has already analyzed all aspects of the cost of living in both cities, with a particular focus on a fair comparison of basic necessities and standardized goods. But to truly experience the ‘pain points’ of consumption in Madrid, let’s look at the minor details where prices are severely imbalanced. These might better reflect your true feelings about quality of life:\nArcade ‘Extravagance’: In Madrid, arcade coin slots devour shiny 1 Euro coins, which directly translate into gameplay. Imagine, in Beijing, you only need to pay 1 RMB for a game token, with discounts for bulk purchases. This ‘currency unit swap,’ where the number looks the same but the value is worlds apart, instantly inflates the cost of simple entertainment by nearly 8 times. It’s fun, but it might hurt your wallet.\n‘Astronomical’ Prices for Stationery and Toys: What’s most astonishing is the price gap for stationery and toys. In Madrid, you’ll often see a scenario where the number on the price tag is the same as in Beijing, but the currency unit has quietly changed from ‘RMB’ to ‘Euro.’ An ordinary toy that sells for 10 RMB in Beijing becomes €10 in Madrid, which is a staggering 78 RMB! This shocking price difference of over 8 times turns what would be an ordinary daily purchase into a heavy burden.\n🧾 Bureaucracy and Convenience 🛠 Slow Bureaucracy: Spanish administrative efficiency is relatively low. 🍱 Fewer and Slower Food Deliveries: Fewer platform choices, high delivery fees. 🛠 Expensive In-Home Services: Difficult to book workers, high costs. ✅ Beijing’s ‘Happiness’ Advantages Fast bureaucracy, comprehensive apps. Convenient food delivery, express shipping, and lifestyle services. Wide variety of consumer goods with high cost-performance. ✅ Conclusion: Do You Want ‘Dignity’ or ‘Ambition’? Dimension Madrid Beijing High-Paying Industries Stable, with a clear ceiling Competitive, but with greater room for advancement Blue-Collar Work Higher income, good social security Lower income, but costs are manageable Pace of Life Slow-paced, gentle social life Fast-paced, resource-intensive Bureaucratic Efficiency Slow, mostly offline Efficient, fully online Consumer Services Expensive labor, fewer lifestyle product categories, fewer entertainment options Low cost, many choices ✊ Final Words: Where to settle down? This is not just a choice of geographical coordinates, but a deep consideration of personal values, life stage, and even financial strength. Here, I will set aside subjective impressions and use a series of real, reliable data to present an unfiltered view of Spain, helping you to understand the true fabric of this nation.\n","wordCount":"1196","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","dateModified":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"/en/spanish-local-income-analysis-madrid-vs-beijing-who-can-live-a-more-decent-life/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"zixia","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=/en/ accesskey=h title="zixia (Alt + H)">zixia</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">

But to truly experience the &lsquo;pain points&rsquo; of consumption in Madrid, let&rsquo;s look at the minor details where prices are severely imbalanced. These might better reflect your true feelings about quality of life:</p><ul><li><strong>Arcade &lsquo;Extravagance&rsquo;:</strong><blockquote><p>In Madrid, arcade coin slots devour shiny <strong>1 Euro coins</strong>, which directly translate into gameplay. Imagine, in Beijing, you only need to pay <strong>1 RMB</strong> for a game token, with discounts for bulk purchases. This &lsquo;currency unit swap,&rsquo; where the number looks the same but the value is worlds apart, instantly inflates the cost of simple entertainment by nearly 8 times. It&rsquo;s fun, but it might hurt your wallet.</p></blockquote></li><li><strong>&lsquo;Astronomical&rsquo; Prices for Stationery and Toys:</strong><blockquote><p>What&rsquo;s most astonishing is the price gap for stationery and toys. In Madrid, you&rsquo;ll often see a scenario where the number on the price tag is the same as in Beijing, but the currency unit has quietly changed from &lsquo;RMB&rsquo; to &lsquo;Euro.&rsquo; An ordinary toy that sells for <strong>10 RMB</strong> in Beijing becomes <strong>€10</strong> in Madrid, which is a staggering <strong>78 RMB</strong>! This <strong>shocking price difference of over 8 times</strong> turns what would be an ordinary daily purchase into a heavy burden.</p></blockquote></li></ul><h3 id=-bureaucracy-and-convenience>🧾 Bureaucracy and Convenience<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#-bureaucracy-and-convenience>#</a></h3><ul><li>🛠 Slow Bureaucracy: Spanish administrative efficiency is relatively low.</li><li>🍱 Fewer and Slower Food Deliveries: Fewer platform choices, high delivery fees.</li><li>🛠 Expensive In-Home Services: Difficult to book workers, high costs.</li></ul><h3 id=-beijings-happiness-advantages>✅ Beijing&rsquo;s &lsquo;Happiness&rsquo; Advantages<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#-beijings-happiness-advantages>#</a></h3><ul><li>Fast bureaucracy, comprehensive apps.</li><li>Convenient food delivery, express shipping, and lifestyle services.</li><li>Wide variety of consumer goods with high cost-performance.</li></ul><hr><h2 id=-conclusion-do-you-want-dignity-or-ambition>✅ Conclusion: Do You Want &lsquo;Dignity&rsquo; or &lsquo;Ambition&rsquo;?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#-conclusion-do-you-want-dignity-or-ambition>#</a></h2><table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:left>Dimension</th><th style=text-align:left>Madrid</th><th style=text-align:left>Beijing</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:left>High-Paying Industries</td><td style=text-align:left>Stable, with a clear ceiling</td><td style=text-align:left>Competitive, but with greater room for advancement</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left>Blue-Collar Work</td><td style=text-align:left>Higher income, good social security</td><td style=text-align:left>Lower income, but costs are manageable</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left>Pace of Life</td><td style=text-align:left>Slow-paced, gentle social life</td><td style=text-align:left>Fast-paced, resource-intensive</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left>Bureaucratic Efficiency</td><td style=text-align:left>Slow, mostly offline</td><td style=text-align:left>Efficient, fully online</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left>Consumer Services</td><td style=text-align:left>Expensive labor, fewer lifestyle product categories, fewer entertainment options</td><td style=text-align:left>Low cost, many choices</td></tr></tbody></table><hr><h2 id=-final-words>✊ Final Words:<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#-final-words>#</a></h2><p>Where to settle down?
