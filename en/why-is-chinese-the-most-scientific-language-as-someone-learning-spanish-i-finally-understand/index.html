🇨🇳 Some Confidence We Should Really Express Out Loud

“Chinese people aren&rsquo;t as beautiful as white people.”
“Chinese people have always been uncivilized.”

The past tense conjugations for the verb ‘hablar’ (to speak) are as follows:\nyo hablé, tú hablaste, él habló…\nChange the person, and the word ending has to change with it. You not only have to memorize 14 tenses but also 6 personal forms, with no discernible pattern, relying entirely on rote memorization.\nAnd what about Chinese?\n我昨天说话了。 他明天要说话。\nThe verb never changes. Tense is expressed by time adverbs like ‘昨天’ (yesterday), ‘明天’ (tomorrow), and ‘要’ (will). This isn’t ’laziness’; it’s the ultimate in logic and efficiency.\n⚖️ No Grammatical Gender, Making Chinese Naturally ‘Egalitarian’ Spanish nouns also have gender:\nel libro rojo (the red book, masculine) la mesa roja (the red table, feminine)\nChinese doesn’t play that game:\n红色的书、红色的桌子\nConcise, clear, and free of gendered burdens. As long as the meaning is accurate, there’s no need to artificially create linguistic differences.\n🧠 No Subject-Verb Agreement, for a Cleaner, Crisper Grammar In English:\nHe runs. / They run.\nThe verb changes with the subject.\nBut in Chinese:\n他跑 / 他们跑\nThe subject changes, but the verb remains completely unchanged, and the logic is still perfectly clear. Low grammatical burden, high expressive efficiency.\n🧩 Chinese Grammar: Word Order is Logic 我把书给了他 (The ‘把’ sentence: active emphasis) 书被他拿走了 (The ‘被’ sentence: passive structure) 他吃了 / 正在吃 / 要吃 (Particles express time) Without verb conjugations or complex rules, relying only on word order and function words, you can build precise expressive structures, as clearly and flexibly as building with Lego bricks.\n🧠 From a Linguistic Perspective: Chinese is an ‘Analytic Language,’ Naturally Efficient Linguists generally classify languages into three types:\nAnalytic Language Fusional Language Agglutinative Language Chinese is a classic representative of analytic languages, while Indo-European languages like English, Spanish, and French belong to the category of fusional languages.\n🔍 Fusional languages rely on word endings to express tense, person, and gender; 🧩 Analytic languages, on the other hand, achieve precise expression through word order, particles, and context.\nIn short, analytic languages are like computer languages—logically clear, structurally predictable, and information-dense.\nChinese requires no redundant variations, yet its expression is highly precise. This isn’t ‘simplification’; it’s an advanced and scientific quality in its linguistic structure.\n💡 Champion of Information Density, with Explosive Expressive Efficiency The same sentence:\nEnglish: The project has been successfully completed. (7 words) Chinese: 项目已完成。 (3 characters)\nThis isn’t compression; it’s the ability to convey information with high abstraction and accuracy.\nWord formation is also extremely logical:\n电 (electricity) + 脑 (brain) = 电脑 (computer) 火 (fire) + 箭 (arrow) = 火箭 (rocket) 光 (light) + 速 (speed) = 光速 (lightspeed) No filler, no redundancy. Efficiency is power.\n🧭 ‘Chinese Isn’t Precise Enough’? That’s a Misunderstanding Some people say Chinese is vague and not detailed enough? They’re wrong. That’s because they are trying to interpret Chinese logic with a Western linguistic mindset.\nTake the character ‘开’ (kāi) for example:\n开车 (drive a car), 开会 (hold a meeting), 开花 (to bloom), 开瓶 (open a bottle), 开盘 (market opening), 开户 (open an account)… Through verb-object combinations, the meaning expands infinitely, precisely, and naturally. It doesn’t rely on lengthy modifications or word endings; the language system automatically assembles meaning, remaining logically self-consistent.\n✍️ Chinese Characters are Complex, But They Make Us Unique Of course, we must also admit: the only real barrier to entry for Chinese is the characters.\nChinese characters are not phonetic symbols but ideograms, with each character carrying information about form, sound, and meaning.\nBut this isn’t a drawback; it’s a symbol of civilizational depth.\nThe character ‘休’ (xiū): a person leaning against a tree, meaning ‘rest’. The character ‘安’ (ān): a woman under a roof, meaning ‘peace’ or ’tranquility’. The ‘人’ (person) radical in characters like ‘信’ (trust), ‘仁’ (benevolence), and ‘忠’ (loyalty) reflects an understanding of and values related to humanity. These are not coincidences but the result of Chinese characters influencing the language’s structure, word formation, and even its mode of thought.\n🌳 The Chinese Language and Characters: An Inseparable Living Community The spoken Chinese language is not an isolated island; it exists in a symbiotic system with its characters.\nLike the roots and leaves of a tree, the language is the skeleton, and the characters are the flesh and blood. Without Chinese characters, the Chinese language could not have become the logically complete and semantically precise system it is today.\nAnd in today’s world of alphabetization and standardization, we are the only cultural group in human civilization that has preserved a complete ideographic writing system.\nThis is both an honor and a responsibility.\n🔁 So, Please Take Another Look at Our Language If you are overseas and have heard that ‘Chinese is too hard’ or ‘Chinese culture is too complex,’ please don’t be quick to accept these labels.\nWhat is truly difficult is not the Chinese language, but the fact that we are gradually losing the ability and confidence to understand, appreciate, and talk about it.\nLanguage is the root of culture; writing is the soul of civilization. We have no reason to bow our heads. Instead, we have every reason to:\nHold our heads high and tell the story of our language, the story of Chinese wisdom and confidence.\n","wordCount":"1079","inLanguage":"zh","datePublished":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","dateModified":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"/en/why-is-chinese-the-most-scientific-language-as-someone-learning-spanish-i-finally-understand/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"zixia","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=/zh/ accesskey=h title="zixia (Alt + H)">zixia</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
