Historical Context: A Philosopher’s Truth vs. an Administrator’s Handbook In the history of Western science, the earliest and most influential mathematical work is Euclid’s Elements (the source of what is often called ‘Euclidean geometry’);\nwhereas in the history of ancient Chinese science, the earliest, most widespread, and most influential mathematical classic is the Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art, compiled during the Han Dynasty.\nComparing these two “most important mathematical classics of their respective civilizations” is not about determining a winner, but about understanding a more practical question:\nWhy did ancient mathematics of a similarly high level\nultimately contribute to modern natural science via two completely different paths?\n1️⃣ Euclid’s Elements: Mathematics for the Sake of ‘Truth Itself’ Date of Compilation: Circa 300 BCE Author: Euclid Role: A ‘Logical Ladder’ to the Laws of the Universe Euclid’s Elements is not concerned with harvests, taxes, or engineering costs.\nIt is concerned with a more fundamental question:\nHow should mathematics itself be defined?\nIt establishes a “deducible world”: starting from the fewest possible premises to deduce as many necessary conclusions as possible.\nThis is why many later Western disciplines adopted it as a “model for theoretical writing and scientific argumentation.”\nSome have even pointed out that the structure of Newton’s Principia Mathematica clearly borrows from the Euclidean system’s “definition-axiom-proposition-proof” style.\n2️⃣ Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art: Mathematics in Service of the Real World Date of Compilation: Circa 2nd century BCE – 1st century CE (Western Han to Eastern Han Dynasty) Author: Compiled and expanded by mathematicians over generations Role: An ‘Administrative Handbook’ for a unified empire It solves the most practical problems:\nLand surveying Tax calculation Construction projects (building dikes, granaries, digging canals) This is a book written for officials and engineers.\nIt does not pursue the “pure truth of the universe”; it pursues:\nSolving problems correctly, quickly, and practically.\nPrecisely because of this strong practicality, the study and application of the Nine Chapters continued in China for a long time, even extending into the Ming and Qing dynasties—it became a “standard algorithm library” for the ancient system of governance and engineering.\nII. A Difference in Starting Points: Beginning with ‘Definitions’ vs. Beginning with ‘Problems’ 📐 Euclid’s Elements: Building a Universe from Nothing Euclid’s opening does not calculate areas or solve equations.\nInstead, it first defines the world itself.\nOriginal Text:\nDefinition 1: A point is that which has no part. Definition 2: A line is breadthless length. Postulate 1: To draw a straight line from any point to any point. Here, Euclid is not performing calculations; he is engaging in abstract modeling.\nThe entire book is built on an extremely rigorous deductive chain:\nDefinitions → Axioms/Postulates → Propositions → Proofs\nThis is a form of mathematics that starts from the question ‘Why is this necessarily true?’\n🌾 Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art: Wisdom Grown from the Land The opening of the Nine Chapters is extremely “down-to-earth.”\nAlmost every chapter begins with a single phrase:\n“Now given…”\n(Meaning: Now there is a practical problem)\nOriginal Text:\nNow given a field 15 paces wide and 16 paces long. Question: what is the area of the field?\nMethod: Multiply the width and length to get the area in square paces.\nIts structure is very consistent:\nProblem → Answer → Method (Algorithm)\nIt does not explain why “length × width = area.”\nIt directly gives you a set of reusable algorithms called “methods” (术)—which, from today’s perspective, are almost like pseudocode.\nIII. The Same Mathematics, Different Thought Processes 1️⃣ The Pythagorean Theorem: Proving Necessity vs. Applying Effectiveness Euclid’s Elements\nIn Proposition I.47, Euclid uses complex geometric constructions to rigorously prove the logical necessity of the relationship between the three sides of a right-angled triangle. Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art\nDirectly provides the formula: Multiply the gou and gu (the two shorter sides) by themselves, add them, and take the square root. This is the hypotenuse.\nIt then immediately applies it to practical problems: measuring water depth, tree height, and determining engineering dimensions.\nOne is proving ‘why it is always correct,’\nthe other is verifying ‘if it is useful enough.’\n2️⃣ Engineering Problem: A ‘Showdown’ for Calculating Officials In ancient mathematical examinations (like the Mingsuan ke of the Tang Dynasty), there was a highly representative engineering problem:\nOriginal Problem (from the ‘Shang Gong’ chapter):\nNow given a dike to be built, with a bottom width of 2 zhang, a top width of 8 chi, a height of 4 chi, and a length of 12 zhang and 7 chi.\nQuestion: What is the volume?\nMethod (Algorithm):\nAdd the top and bottom widths, halve the sum, multiply by the height, and then multiply by the length.\nThis is the standard algorithm for the volume of a trapezoidal prism.\nIf Euclid were to solve this:\nHe would require you to prove the formula for the area of a trapezoid and derive it by decomposing the trapezoid into triangles.\nA Chinese examination candidate, however, would simply: move the counting rods and execute the algorithm.\nThis highly algorithmic educational system gave ancient China an extremely powerful capacity for engineering execution—it could turn “governance” into something “calculable” and “engineering” into something “operable.”\n3️⃣ Positive and Negative Numbers: The Art of Red and Black This is one of Chinese mathematics’ most important contributions to humanity.\nNine Chapters on the Mathematical Art · ‘Fangcheng’ (Equations) Chapter\nTo handle the cancellation of coefficients, it introduced positive and negative numbers: Red counting rods represent positive, black counting rods represent negative.\nIt also systematically provided the rules of addition and subtraction for the “Method of Positive and Negative.”\nIn contrast\nAncient Greek mathematics long held that “length cannot be negative” and thus considered negative numbers absurd. The attitude of Chinese mathematicians was more like that of an engineer:\nAs long as the algorithm is logically self-consistent, it doesn’t need to be intuitively visible.\nIV. If You Only Have Time for a Glance, This Table Is Enough Dimension Nine Chapters (East) Elements (West) Cognitive Preference Algorithmic Thinking: How to calculate Logical Thinking: Why it works Form of Mathematics Discrete, Algebraic, Numerical Calculation Continuous, Geometric, Spatial Modeling Methodology Induction: Generalizing rules from specific cases Deduction: Deriving specific conclusions from axioms Focus Executability and Efficiency Self-consistency and Universality Weaknesses Lacks rigorous logical proofs, relies on empirical summaries Overly detached from practical use, once considered ‘impractical’ Scientific Contribution Ensured the long-term continuity of engineering and governance techniques The logical foundation for the grand edifice of modern natural science V. The Key Divergence: Why Was the Nine Chapters ‘Long-Lived’ but Less ‘Foundational’ Than Elements? The practicality of the Nine Chapters did indeed ensure its study and application in China continued into the Ming and Qing dynasties. Many later mathematicians often deepened and extended their work based on the problems posed in the Nine Chapters.\nBut it also had an unavoidable structural shortcoming:\nIt provided almost no clear mathematical concepts, theorem systems, or systematic proofs.\nIn contrast, Euclid’s Elements was the opposite.\nIt might not directly help build a dike, but it provided the “scaffolding for the edifice of science”:\nHow to define concepts How to establish axioms and postulates How to prove propositions How to build a self-consistent system This structure had a profound impact on later natural sciences—modern science requires not only the ability to “calculate” but also the ability to “build theories.”\nSo, the final result is:\nThe Nine Chapters is more like an “algorithm library for governance and engineering,”\nwhile Elements is more like a “building code for scientific theory.”\nVI. How Does This Divergence Continue Today? This difference between the “algorithmic gene” and the “logical gene” has re-emerged in the 21st century.\nThe West (the Elements gene) excels at going from 0 to 1:\nNeural network theory, large model frameworks, computational paradigm innovation\nIt solves: Why the model is viable The East (the Nine Chapters gene) excels at going from 1 to 100:\nAlgorithm compression, inference acceleration, engineering implementation, cost optimization\nIt solves: How to perfect the model This is not about which is superior, but about different choices of path.\nConclusion The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art is the wisdom of the earth, teaching us how to solve problems pragmatically;\nEuclid’s Elements is a contemplation under the starry sky, teaching us how to construct a rational world.\nTo this day, we still stand at the intersection of these two traditions.\nTrue breakthroughs often come from:\nUsing logic to verify algorithms,\nand using algorithms to implement logic.\n","wordCount":"1493","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","dateModified":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.houdao.org/en/the-pinnacle-of-algorithms-and-the-source-of-logic-when-the-nine-chapters-on-the-mathematical-art-meets-euclid-s-elements/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"zixia","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://www.houdao.org/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://www.houdao.org/en/ accesskey=h title="zixia (Alt + H)">zixia</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
