During the driving road test in Spain, the examiner will only give instructions in Spanish, and the instructor is generally not allowed to translate. Therefore, it is crucial to master the following common Spanish commands and their expressions:

Start the engine: Arrancar
Turn right: Derecha
Turn left: Izquierda
Go straight: Recto
Make a U-turn: Cambio de sentido
Indirect left turn: izquierda indirecto
Roundabout: Rotonda
First exit: Primera salida
Second exit: Segunda salida

For example, if instructed to turn right but there is a traffic sign at the intersection or on the road prohibiting a right turn, you should ignore the instruction and continue to follow the road signs.\nAt the same time, you should maintain a wide field of vision while driving. Note that road markings are often about 30 meters before an intersection, and there may be no corresponding signs at the intersection itself. Also, pay attention to vertical signs and traffic lights, with traffic lights having the highest priority. If there is a vertical STOP sign at an intersection but also a green light, you must strictly follow the higher-priority traffic light and not stop.\nAnalysis of Roundabout Rules Urban roundabouts:\nFor left turns and U-turns, you must use the inner lane. When the inner lane has a traffic light, you can proceed directly on a green light. A flashing yellow light means you must yield to traffic from the right. Be sure to look to your right; if a car is 25 meters away, you must yield because it’s approaching quickly. For right turns and going straight, you should choose the outer lane. Roundabouts outside the city:\nAlways use the outer lane, unless you are overtaking, in which case you can use the inner lane. When exiting a roundabout, be sure to signal right in advance and use your turn signals correctly to assist with lane changes. If traffic is congested and you cannot change from the inner lane to exit the roundabout, you should continue circling until it is safe to change lanes, and then switch to the rightmost lane (the further right, the better) to exit (in Spain, making consecutive lane changes is allowed). For roundabouts divided into several islands, enter from the rightmost lane for a circling left turn, and choose the middle or leftmost lane for going straight. The keyword is indirecto.\nLane Selection and Intersection Driving When going straight:\nIf there are three lanes, you should generally choose the first lane from the right; If there are more than three lanes, it is recommended to use the second lane. When passing through an intersection:\nAvoid stopping on pedestrian crossings, bike lanes, or other special lanes, especially in congested areas marked with a crosshatched grid. If the vehicle in front of you stops due to lack of space, you should stop early and wait, ensuring your stopping position does not obstruct special lanes. Safe Driving and Right-of-Way Awareness Spanish traffic laws are very strict about the right-of-way. People have a strong sense of right-of-way. On pedestrian crossings without traffic lights, pedestrians have absolute priority. They are not in the habit of looking left and right for traffic and may cross suddenly. Therefore, when driving in an area where you do not have the right-of-way, you must remain highly alert, especially in sections with yield signs. You need to check for approaching traffic in the bike lane or vehicle lane behind you and turn your head to confirm the traffic situation.\nHowever, when you have a green light, even if there are pedestrians on the crosswalk, you must not slow down or stop in advance, unless there is an unavoidable emergency, in which case only an emergency brake is permitted. When passing a crosswalk without a traffic light, you should slow down appropriately. If there are signs indicating students or children, you must also perform a braking action to slow down.\nThe speed limit on urban roads is generally 50 km/h, while single-lane roads may be limited to 30 or 20 km/h. Roads outside the city are generally 90 km/h, and highways are 120 km/h. Generally, you are expected to drive as close to the speed limit as possible; even exceeding it by 2-5 km/h is acceptable.\nSTOP Signs and Temporary Stopping Requirements When you encounter a STOP line on the road, you must stop before the line for 3 seconds, and then stop again about 1-2 meters past the line to check for traffic. This double stop is a test requirement. If visibility is poor, you should stop multiple times to confirm it is safe.\nHowever, note: if there is also a traffic light, you must strictly follow the light’s signal. You are not allowed to stop on a green light; you must proceed directly. Stopping in this situation will result in a penalty. If there is no stop line, position your car about one meter into the intersection, stop for at least 3 seconds, and proceed only after confirming it is safe.\nRoad Test Procedure and Driving Strategy The road test usually begins with 3-5 minutes of independent driving, after which the examiner will give instructions based on the situation. Since you may not be familiar with many roads on your first drive, it’s advisable to look at distant road signs in advance. For example, you might need to enter a roundabout from the left lane, while the right lane is for other directions; there are usually traffic signs above the intersection to indicate this. Sometimes, a left turn doesn’t necessarily mean using the left lane; you might need to make the turn from the right lane. For such situations, you need to observe the road markings or overhead signs ahead of time and prepare to change lanes. If it’s already too late to change lanes, it’s better to disobey the examiner’s instruction than to force a dangerous lane change.\nIf road markings are hard to see because they are blocked by a large vehicle or are faded, and there are no clear directional or prohibitive signs at the intersection, you can watch for hand signals from your instructor. When in doubt, it’s advisable to choose to turn right and avoid turning left if possible.\nThe road sign above indicates entering the roundabout from the left lane.\nPrioritize the traffic light on the right; do not stop at the STOP sign when the light is green.\nThe road markings indicate a right turn only, but there is no sign at the intersection prohibiting a left turn. Therefore, it’s hard to know you can’t turn left if a large vehicle is blocking the view.\nTwo ways to navigate a roundabout\n","wordCount":"1172","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","dateModified":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"/en/my-experience-passing-the-spanish-driving-road-test/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"zixia","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=/en/ accesskey=h title="zixia (Alt + H)">zixia</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
