Historical Context: A Philosopher’s Truth vs. an Administrator’s Handbook In the history of Western science, the earliest and most influential mathematical work is Euclid’s Elements (the origin of what is often called ‘Euclidean geometry’). In the history of ancient Chinese science, the earliest, most widespread, and most influential mathematical classic is The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art, compiled during the Han Dynasty.\nComparing these two “most important mathematical classics of their respective civilizations” is not about picking a winner, but about understanding a more practical question:\nWhy did ancient mathematics of similarly high levels ultimately contribute to modern natural science along two completely different paths?\n1️⃣ Euclid’s Elements: Mathematics for the Sake of ‘Truth Itself’ Date of Compilation: Circa 300 BCE Author: Euclid Role: A ‘Logical Ladder’ to the Laws of the Universe Elements is not concerned with harvests, taxes, or engineering costs. It is concerned with a more fundamental question:\nHow should mathematics itself be defined?\nIt establishes a ‘deducible world’: starting from the fewest possible premises to derive as many necessary conclusions as possible. This is why many later Western disciplines adopted it as a ‘model for theoretical writing and scientific argumentation.’\nSome have even pointed out that the structure of Newton’s Principia Mathematica clearly borrows from the Euclidean system’s ‘definition-axiom-proposition-proof’ style.\n2️⃣ The Nine Chapters: Mathematics in Service of the Real World Date of Compilation: Circa 2nd century BCE – 1st century CE (Western Han to Eastern Han Dynasty) Author: Compiled and supplemented by mathematicians over generations Role: A ‘Management Handbook’ for a unified empire It solves the most practical problems:\nLand measurement Tax calculation Engineering works (building dikes, granaries, digging canals) This was a book written for officials and engineers. It does not pursue ’the pure truth of the universe’; it pursues:\nSolving problems correctly, quickly, and practically.\nPrecisely because of this strong practicality, the study and application of The Nine Chapters continued in China for a long time, even into the Ming and Qing dynasties. It became a ‘standard algorithm library’ for ancient social governance and engineering systems.\nII. Different Starting Points: Beginning with ‘Definitions’ vs. Beginning with ‘Problems’ 📐 Euclid’s Elements: Building a Universe from Abstraction Euclid’s opening doesn’t calculate areas or solve equations. Instead, it first defines the world itself.\nOriginal Text:\nDefinition 1: A point is that which has no part. Definition 2: A line is breadthless length. Postulate 1: To draw a straight line from any point to any point. Here, Euclid is not performing calculations; he is engaging in abstract modeling. The entire book is built on an extremely rigorous deductive chain:\nDefinitions → Axioms/Postulates → Propositions → Proofs\nThis is a form of mathematics that starts from the question ‘Why is this necessarily true?’\n🌾 The Nine Chapters: Wisdom Grown from the Land The opening of The Nine Chapters is extremely ‘down-to-earth.’ Almost every chapter begins with a phrase:\n‘Now there is…’ (meaning, ‘Here is a practical problem’)\nOriginal Text:\nNow there is a field with a width of 15 paces and a length of 16 paces. Question: What is the area? The rule says: Multiply the width and length to get the area in square paces.\nIts structure is very consistent:\nProblem → Answer → Rule (Algorithm)\nIt doesn’t explain why ’length × width = area.’ It directly gives you a set of reusable algorithms called ‘术’ (rules or methods)— which, from a modern perspective, are almost like pseudocode.\nIII. The Same Mathematics, Different Thought Processes 1️⃣ The Pythagorean Theorem: Proving Necessity vs. Applying Effectiveness Euclid’s Elements In Proposition I.47, Euclid uses complex geometric constructions to rigorously prove the logical necessity of the relationship between the three sides of a right-angled triangle. The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art Directly provides the formula: Multiply the base and height by themselves, add them, and take the square root to find the hypotenuse. It then immediately applies it to practical problems: measuring water depth, tree height, and determining engineering dimensions.\nOne is proving ‘why it must be right,’ the other is verifying ‘if it’s good enough to use.’\n2️⃣ Engineering Problem: A ‘Showdown’ for Mathematical Officials In ancient mathematical examinations (like the Mingsuan ke of the Tang Dynasty), there was a highly representative engineering problem:\nPrototype Problem (from the ‘Shang Gong’ chapter):\nNow there is a dike to be built. The lower width is 2 zhang, the upper width is 8 chi, the height is 4 chi, and the length is 12 zhang and 7 chi. Question: What is the volume?\nThe Rule (Algorithm):\nAdd the upper and lower widths, halve the sum, multiply by the height, and then multiply by the length.\nThis is the standard algorithm for the volume of a trapezoidal prism.\nIf Euclid were to solve this: He would require you to prove the formula for the area of a trapezoid and derive it by breaking the shape into multiple triangles. A Chinese candidate, however, would simply move the counting rods and execute the algorithm.\nThis highly algorithmic educational system gave ancient China an extremely powerful engineering execution capability— it could turn ‘governance’ into something ‘computable’ and ’engineering’ into something ‘operable.’\n3️⃣ Positive and Negative Numbers: The Art of Red and Black This is one of the most important contributions of Chinese mathematics to humanity.\nThe Nine Chapters, ‘Fangcheng’ (Equations) Chapter To handle the cancellation of coefficients, it introduced positive and negative numbers: Red rods represent positive, black rods represent negative. It also systematically provided rules for addition and subtraction (‘The Art of the Positive and Negative’).\nIn contrast Ancient Greek mathematics long held that ’length cannot be negative’ and thus considered negative numbers absurd. The attitude of Chinese mathematicians was more like that of an engineer:\nAs long as the algorithm is logically self-consistent, it doesn’t need to be intuitively visible.\nIV. If You Only Have Time for a Glance, This Table Is Enough Dimension The Nine Chapters (East) Elements (West) Thought Preference Algorithmic Thinking: How to calculate Logical Thinking: Why it works Mathematical Form Discrete, Algebraic, Numerical Calculation Continuous, Geometric, Spatial Modeling Methodology Induction: Summarizing general rules from cases Deduction: Deriving specific conclusions from axioms Key Focus Executability and Efficiency Self-consistency and Universality Weakness Lacks rigorous logical proofs, relies on empirical summaries Overly detached from practical use, once considered ‘frivolous’ Scientific Contribution Ensured the long-term continuation of engineering and governance techniques The logical foundation for the grand edifice of modern natural science V. The Key Divergence: Why Was The Nine Chapters ‘Long-Lived’ but Less ‘Foundational’ than Elements? The practicality of The Nine Chapters indeed ensured its study and application in China continued into the Ming and Qing dynasties: Many later mathematicians often deepened and generalized the problems posed in The Nine Chapters.\nBut it also had a structural shortcoming that cannot be ignored:\nIt provided almost no clear mathematical concepts, theorem systems, or systematic proofs.\nEuclid’s Elements, on the other hand, was the exact opposite. It might not have been used to directly build dikes, but it provided the ‘scaffolding for the edifice of science’:\nHow to define concepts How to set axioms and postulates How to prove propositions How to build a self-consistent system This structure had a profound impact on later natural sciences— modern science requires not only the ability to ‘calculate’ but, more importantly, the ability to ‘build theories.’\nSo the final result is: The Nine Chapters is more like an ‘algorithm library for governance and engineering,’ while Elements is more like a ‘construction manual for scientific theory.’\nVI. How Does This Divergence Continue Today? This difference between the ‘algorithmic gene’ and the ’logical gene’ has re-emerged in the 21st century.\nThe West (the Elements gene) excels at going from 0 to 1: Neural network theory, large model frameworks, innovations in computing paradigms It solves the question: Why is the model viable? The East (the Nine Chapters gene) excels at going from 1 to 100: Algorithm compression, inference acceleration, engineering implementation, cost optimization It solves the question: How to perfect the model’s implementation? This isn’t about which is superior, but about different choices of path.\nConclusion The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art is the wisdom of the earth, teaching us how to solve problems pragmatically. Euclid’s Elements is a contemplation under the stars, teaching us how to construct a rational world.\nTo this day, we still stand at the intersection of these two traditions.\nTrue breakthroughs often come from:\nUsing logic to verify algorithms, and using algorithms to implement logic.\n","wordCount":"1489","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","dateModified":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"/en/suan-fa-zhi-dian-yu-luo-ji-zhi-yuan-dang-jiu-zhang-suan-shu-yu-jian-ji-he-yuan-ben/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"zixia","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=/en/ accesskey=h title="zixia (Alt + H)">zixia</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">

Many later mathematicians often deepened and generalized the problems posed in <em>The Nine Chapters</em>.</p><p>But it also had a structural shortcoming that cannot be ignored:</p><blockquote><p><strong>It provided almost no clear mathematical concepts, theorem systems, or systematic proofs.</strong></p></blockquote><p>Euclid&rsquo;s <em>Elements</em>, on the other hand, was the exact opposite.
It might not have been used to directly build dikes, but it provided the &lsquo;scaffolding for the edifice of science&rsquo;:</p><ul><li>How to define concepts</li><li>How to set axioms and postulates</li><li>How to prove propositions</li><li>How to build a self-consistent system</li></ul><p>This structure had a profound impact on later natural sciences—
modern science requires not only the ability to &lsquo;calculate&rsquo; but, more importantly, the ability to &lsquo;build theories.&rsquo;</p><blockquote><p><strong>So the final result is:</strong>
<em>The Nine Chapters</em> is more like an &lsquo;algorithm library for governance and engineering,&rsquo;
while <em>Elements</em> is more like a &lsquo;construction manual for scientific theory.&rsquo;</p></blockquote><hr><h2 id=vi-how-does-this-divergence-continue-today>VI. How Does This Divergence Continue Today?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#vi-how-does-this-divergence-continue-today>#</a></h2><p>This difference between the &lsquo;algorithmic gene&rsquo; and the &rsquo;logical gene&rsquo; has re-emerged in the 21st century.</p><ul><li><strong>The West (the <em>Elements</em> gene)</strong> excels at going from <strong>0 to 1</strong>:
Neural network theory, large model frameworks, innovations in computing paradigms
It solves the question: <strong>Why is the model viable?</strong></li><li><strong>The East (the <em>Nine Chapters</em> gene)</strong> excels at going from <strong>1 to 100</strong>:
Algorithm compression, inference acceleration, engineering implementation, cost optimization
It solves the question: <strong>How to perfect the model&rsquo;s implementation?</strong></li></ul><p>This isn&rsquo;t about which is superior,
but about <strong>different choices of path</strong>.</p><hr><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#conclusion>#</a></h2><p><em>The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art</em> is the wisdom of the earth, teaching us how to solve problems pragmatically.
Euclid&rsquo;s <em>Elements</em> is a contemplation under the stars, teaching us how to construct a rational world.</p><p>To this day, we still stand at the intersection of these two traditions.</p><p><strong>True breakthroughs often come from:</strong></p><blockquote><p><strong>Using logic to verify algorithms,</strong>
<strong>and using algorithms to implement logic.</strong></p></blockquote></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul></footer></article></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2026 <a href=/en/>zixia</a></span> ·
