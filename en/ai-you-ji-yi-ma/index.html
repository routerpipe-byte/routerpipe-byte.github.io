For example, if you ask a question and then follow up on it a little later, it can still connect the dots. This leads to a common question: does AI actually have memory?\nLet’s get straight to the point: An AI’s “memory” is not the archive-style memory people imagine. It relies on predicting with parameter weights, not on hard-drive-style storage.\n1. An AI’s Memory Is Actually a Lot Like the Human Brain An AI doesn’t save data verbatim like a computer’s hard drive.\nIts “memory” comes from its vast parameter weights.\nFor example, if you ask it to recite the poem “A Spring Morning”—“春眠不觉晓，处处闻啼鸟”.\nThe reason the AI can recite it completely isn’t because it archived the poem word for word, but because during training, its parameter weights learned the patterns of the language: after “春眠不觉” (chūn mián bù jué), the most likely character to appear is “晓” (xiǎo).\nThis is very similar to how the human brain remembers: when we recall information, we also rely on the weighted connections between neurons to predict and reconstruct, rather than mechanically storing it like a computer.\n2. Why Does It Feel Like the AI Remembers the Conversation? You feel the AI “remembers what you said” because the system repackages the previous conversation and feeds it back to the model with each new query.\nSome systems append the full history, while others compress or summarize it before passing it to the model.\nSo, when an AI appears to “remember,” it’s actually a result of the external prompt, not because it truly has a memory.\n3. Conversations Don’t Change an AI’s Memory This is a crucial point: your conversation with an AI does not change its parameter weights.\nThe model’s weights are only updated during training and upgrades, not during everyday conversations.\nIn other words, even if you tell it a hundred times, “Remember my name is Xiaoming,” the AI’s parameters won’t change. The next time it “sees” you, it might still have no idea who you are.\nTherefore, an AI can’t remember your conversation on its own; it relies on “appending the chat history to the prompt” to maintain continuity.\n4. Why Do AIs Make More Mistakes in Long Conversations? Every model has a token limit (a maximum capacity for processing text).\nAs the conversation history gets longer:\nEarly parts of the conversation might be truncated, so the AI naturally “forgets” them. If the compression or indexing is incomplete, its understanding can become skewed. Once the capacity is exceeded, the AI can get confused, and its error rate increases. 5. Summary An AI’s memory is like a human brain, not a hard drive. It relies on parameter weights for prediction, not verbatim storage. When you feel it remembers the conversation, it’s actually because the system is “appending the chat history to the prompt.” Conversations cannot change an AI’s parameter weights; true updates only happen when the model is upgraded. When a conversation gets too long and exceeds the model’s capacity, the AI is more likely to make mistakes. So, don’t think of an AI as a computer that “archives” data. It’s more like an instant prediction machine: relying on weighted connections to calculate the next most logical word and sentence in real-time.\n","wordCount":"560","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","dateModified":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"/en/ai-you-ji-yi-ma/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"zixia","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=/en/ accesskey=h title="zixia (Alt + H)">zixia</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
