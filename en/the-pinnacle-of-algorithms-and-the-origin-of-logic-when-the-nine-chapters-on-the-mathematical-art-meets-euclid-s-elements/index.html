Historical Context: The Truth of Philosophers vs. The Handbook of Administrators In the history of Western science, the earliest and most influential mathematical work is Euclid’s Elements (the source of what later became known as “Euclidean geometry”). In the history of ancient Chinese science, the earliest, most widespread, and most influential mathematical classic is The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art, compiled during the Han Dynasty.\nComparing these two “most important mathematical classics of their respective civilizations” is not about determining a winner, but about understanding a more practical question:\nWhy did ancient mathematics of similarly high levels ultimately contribute to modern natural science via two completely different paths?\n1️⃣ Euclid’s Elements: Mathematics for the Sake of “Truth Itself” Date of Compilation: Circa 300 BCE Author: Euclid Role: A “Logical Ladder” to the Laws of the Universe Euclid’s Elements was not concerned with harvests, taxes, or engineering costs. It was concerned with a more fundamental question:\nHow should mathematics itself be defined?\nIt was building a “deducible world”: starting from the fewest possible premises to derive as many necessary conclusions as possible. This is why many later Western disciplines adopted it as a “model for theoretical writing and scientific argumentation.”\nSome have even pointed out that the structure of Newton’s Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica clearly borrows from the Euclidean system’s “definition-axiom-proposition-proof” style.\n2️⃣ The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art: Mathematics in Service of the Real World Date of Compilation: Circa 2nd century BCE – 1st century CE (Western Han to Eastern Han) Author: Compiled and supplemented by mathematicians over generations Role: An “Administrative Handbook” for a unified empire It solved the most practical problems:\nLand measurement Tax calculation Engineering works (building dikes, granaries, digging canals) This was a book written for officials and engineers. It did not pursue “the pure truth of the universe”; it pursued:\nGetting the problem solved correctly, quickly, and practically.\nPrecisely because of this strong practicality, the study and application of The Nine Chapters continued in China for a long time, even extending into the Ming and Qing dynasties. It became, in effect, a “standard algorithm library” for ancient social governance and engineering systems.\nII. A Difference in Starting Points: From “Definitions” vs. From “Problems” 📐 Euclid’s Elements: Building a Universe from the Void Euclid’s opening doesn’t calculate areas or solve equations. Instead, it first defines the world itself.\nOriginal Text:\nDefinition 1: A point is that which has no part. A point is that which has no part. Definition 2: A line is breadthless length. Postulate 1: To draw a straight line from any point to any point. Here, Euclid is not calculating; he is engaging in abstract modeling. The entire book is built on an extremely rigorous deductive chain:\nDefinitions → Axioms/Postulates → Propositions → Proofs\nThis is a form of mathematics that starts from the question “Why must this be true?”\n🌾 The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art: Wisdom Grown from the Land The opening of The Nine Chapters is extremely “down-to-earth.” Almost every chapter begins with the phrase:\n“今有……” (Meaning, “Suppose there is…” or “Now we have a practical problem.”)\nOriginal Text:\n今有田广十五步，从十六步。问为田几何？ 术曰：广从步数相乘，得积步。\nIts structure is very consistent:\nProblem → Answer → Method (Algorithm)\nIt doesn’t explain why “length × width = area.” It directly gives you a set of reusable algorithms called “术” (shù, or methods)—which, from a modern perspective, are almost like pseudocode.\nIII. The Same Mathematics, Different Paths of Thought 1️⃣ The Pythagorean Theorem: Proving Inevitability vs. Applying Effectiveness Euclid’s Elements In Proposition I.47, Euclid uses complex geometric constructions to rigorously prove the logical necessity of the relationship between the three sides of a right-angled triangle. The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art Directly provides the formula: Square the gou and gu (the two shorter sides), add them, and take the square root; this is the hypotenuse. It then immediately applies it: measuring the depth of water, the height of a tree, or the dimensions for an engineering project.\nOne is proving “why it must be correct,” while the other is verifying “if it’s useful enough.”\n2️⃣ An Engineering Problem: A “Showdown” for Calculating Officials In ancient mathematics examinations (like the Ming-suan ke of the Tang Dynasty), there was a highly representative engineering problem:\nPrototype Problem (from the “Shang Gong” chapter):\nNow there is a dike to be built. The lower width is 2 zhang, the upper width is 8 chi, the height is 4 chi, and the length is 12 zhang and 7 chi. Question: What is the volume?\nMethod (Algorithm):\nAdd the upper and lower widths and halve the sum, multiply by the height, and then multiply by the length.\nThis is the standard algorithm for the volume of a trapezoidal prism.\nIf Euclid were to solve this: He would require you to first prove the formula for the area of a trapezoid, likely by deconstructing it into triangles and then deriving the result. A Chinese candidate, however, would simply need to: move the counting rods and execute the algorithm.\nThis highly algorithmic educational system gave ancient China an extremely powerful capacity for engineering execution—it turned “governance” into something “calculable” and “engineering” into something “operable.”\n3️⃣ Positive and Negative Numbers: The Art of Red and Black This is one of Chinese mathematics’ most important contributions to humanity.\nThe Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art · “Fangcheng” (Equations) Chapter To handle the cancellation of coefficients, it introduced positive and negative numbers: Red counting rods represent positive; black counting rods represent negative. It also systematically provided the “rules of positive and negative” for addition and subtraction.\nIn contrast Ancient Greek mathematics long considered “length cannot be negative” and thus viewed negative numbers as absurd. The attitude of Chinese mathematicians was more like that of an engineer:\nAs long as the algorithm is logically self-consistent, it doesn’t need to be intuitively visible.\nIV. If You Only Have Time for a Glance, This Table Is Enough Dimension The Nine Chapters (East) Euclid’s Elements (West) Thinking Preference Algorithmic Thinking: How to calculate Logical Thinking: Why it works Mathematical Form Discrete, Algebraic, Numerical Continuous, Geometric, Spatial Modeling Methodology Induction: Generalizing rules from cases Deduction: Deriving conclusions from axioms Key Focus Executability \u0026 Efficiency Consistency \u0026 Universality Weaknesses Lacks rigorous logical proof; relies on empirical summarization Overly detached from practical use; once considered “frivolous” Scientific Contribution Ensured the long-term continuation of engineering and governance techniques The logical foundation for the grand edifice of modern natural science V. The Key Divergence: Why Was The Nine Chapters “Long-Lived” but Less “Foundational” than Elements? The practicality of The Nine Chapters did indeed ensure its study and application in China continued into the Ming and Qing dynasties: Many later mathematicians often deepened and expanded upon the problems first posed in The Nine Chapters.\nBut it also had an unavoidable structural shortcoming:\nIt provided almost no clear mathematical concepts, theorem systems, or systematic proofs.\nIn contrast, Euclid’s Elements was the opposite. It might not directly help build a dike, but it provided the “scaffolding for the edifice of science”:\nHow to define concepts How to establish axioms and postulates How to prove propositions How to build a self-consistent system This framework had a profound impact on later natural sciences—modern science requires not only the ability to “calculate” but, more importantly, the ability to “build theories.”\nSo, the end result is: The Nine Chapters is more like an “algorithm library for governance and engineering,” Elements is more like a “building code for scientific theory.”\nVI. How Does This Divergence Continue Today? This difference between “algorithmic DNA” and “logical DNA” has re-emerged in the 21st century.\nThe West (Euclidean DNA) excels at going from 0 to 1: Neural network theory, large model frameworks, innovations in computing paradigms It solves the question: Why is the model viable? The East (Nine Chapters DNA) excels at going from 1 to 100: Algorithm compression, inference acceleration, engineering implementation, cost optimization It solves the question: How do we perfect the model’s implementation? This isn’t about which is superior, but about different choices of path.\nConclusion The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art is the wisdom of the earth, teaching us how to solve problems pragmatically. Euclid’s Elements is a contemplation under the stars, teaching us how to construct a rational world.\nToday, we still stand at the intersection of these two traditions.\nTrue breakthroughs often come from:\nUsing logic to verify algorithms, And using algorithms to implement logic.\n","wordCount":"1492","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","dateModified":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"/en/the-pinnacle-of-algorithms-and-the-origin-of-logic-when-the-nine-chapters-on-the-mathematical-art-meets-euclid-s-elements/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"zixia","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=/en/ accesskey=h title="zixia (Alt + H)">zixia</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">

Question: What is the volume?</p></blockquote><p><strong>Method (Algorithm):</strong></p><blockquote><p><strong>Add the upper and lower widths and halve the sum, multiply by the height, and then multiply by the length.</strong></p></blockquote><p>This is the standard <strong>algorithm for the volume of a trapezoidal prism</strong>.</p><p>If Euclid were to solve this:
He would require you to first prove the formula for the area of a trapezoid, likely by deconstructing it into triangles and then deriving the result.
A Chinese candidate, however, would simply need to: move the counting rods and execute the algorithm.</p><p>This highly <strong>algorithmic educational system</strong> gave ancient China an extremely powerful capacity for engineering execution—it turned &ldquo;governance&rdquo; into something &ldquo;calculable&rdquo; and &ldquo;engineering&rdquo; into something &ldquo;operable.&rdquo;</p><hr><h3 id=3-positive-and-negative-numbers-the-art-of-red-and-black>3️⃣ Positive and Negative Numbers: The Art of Red and Black<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#3-positive-and-negative-numbers-the-art-of-red-and-black>#</a></h3><p>This is one of Chinese mathematics&rsquo; most important contributions to humanity.</p><ul><li><strong><em>The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art</em> · &ldquo;Fangcheng&rdquo; (Equations) Chapter</strong>
To handle the cancellation of coefficients, it introduced positive and negative numbers:<blockquote><p><strong>Red counting rods represent positive; black counting rods represent negative.</strong>
It also systematically provided the &ldquo;rules of positive and negative&rdquo; for addition and subtraction.</p></blockquote></li><li><strong>In contrast</strong>
Ancient Greek mathematics long considered &ldquo;length cannot be negative&rdquo; and thus viewed negative numbers as absurd.</li></ul><p>The attitude of Chinese mathematicians was more like that of an engineer:</p><blockquote><p><strong>As long as the algorithm is logically self-consistent, it doesn&rsquo;t need to be intuitively visible.</strong></p></blockquote><hr><h2 id=iv-if-you-only-have-time-for-a-glance-this-table-is-enough>IV.

Many later mathematicians often deepened and expanded upon the problems first posed in <em>The Nine Chapters</em>.</p><p>But it also had an unavoidable structural shortcoming:</p><blockquote><p><strong>It provided almost no clear mathematical concepts, theorem systems, or systematic proofs.</strong></p></blockquote><p>In contrast, <em>Euclid&rsquo;s Elements</em> was the opposite.
It might not directly help build a dike, but it provided the &ldquo;scaffolding for the edifice of science&rdquo;:</p><ul><li>How to define concepts</li><li>How to establish axioms and postulates</li><li>How to prove propositions</li><li>How to build a self-consistent system</li></ul><p>This framework had a profound impact on later natural sciences—modern science requires not only the ability to &ldquo;calculate&rdquo; but, more importantly, the ability to &ldquo;build theories.&rdquo;</p><blockquote><p><strong>So, the end result is:</strong>
