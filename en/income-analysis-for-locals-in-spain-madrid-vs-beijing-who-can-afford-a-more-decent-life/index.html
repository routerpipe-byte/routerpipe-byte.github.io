One commenter asked, “Why not compare the income of Spanish locals? For them, these prices are nothing.”\nAlright, let’s complete the picture today: What are the income levels in Madrid and Beijing really like? We’ll cover high-income earners, blue-collar workers, and post-tax disposable income all in one go.\n1. Post-Tax Income is the Real Purchasing Power To measure the standard of living in a place, you can’t just look at gross salary. Post-tax disposable income (the actual income after deducting personal income tax, social security, etc.) is what truly reflects a resident’s financial capacity.\n📌 Why Compare Post-Tax Income? High tax burdens are a real expense. Due to banking transparency, all income in Spain is subject to taxation, ranging from approximately 19% to 47% or even higher. Cash transactions are restricted. Financial transparency means single cash transactions cannot exceed €1,000; otherwise, it’s considered illegal. All Spanish banks are connected to the tax agency. Whether it’s a transfer between individuals or a payment from a company to an individual, if the amount is large or the frequency is unusual, the bank is obligated to ask the recipient for the reason for the transaction and relevant tax payment proof. If a reasonable and legal justification cannot be provided, the account is highly likely to be frozen. 2. Madrid vs. Beijing: Per Capita Post-Tax Income Comparison 🇪🇸 Madrid Post-tax monthly salary (2024, Instarem data): Approx. €2,174 Annual income: €2,174 × 12 = €26,088 Equivalent in RMB: Approx. ¥203,486 (at 1€ ≈ 7.8 RMB) ⚠ Note: This is the average post-tax salary for “full-time wage earners” and is not equivalent to “per capita disposable income” (which also includes property income, transfer income, etc.). Due to a lack of official statistics, we use post-tax salary as an estimation basis here.\n🇨🇳 Beijing City-wide per capita disposable income (2024): ¥85,415 Urban residents’ per capita disposable income: ¥92,464 ✅ This data is from the National Bureau of Statistics of China and is already a “post-tax” figure, covering all residents (regardless of profession).\n📊 Preliminary Conclusion In terms of post-tax income: Madrid’s is approximately 2.2 times that of Beijing. However, this is just an average. For a true comparison, we need to look at it by profession. 3. High-Skilled Professionals: Beijing Has an Edge Although Spain’s average salary seems higher, once we break it down by specific industries, especially for high-skilled professionals, Beijing’s competitiveness immediately becomes apparent.\n👩‍🏫 1. University Lecturer Region Pre-tax Annual Salary Post-tax Estimate Equivalent in RMB Madrid €35,000–45,000 €28,000–36,000 ¥218,400–281,000 Beijing ¥200,000–350,000 Already post-tax ¥200,000–350,000 ✅ Summary: Incomes at top Beijing universities have surpassed Madrid’s, and the average level is basically on par.\n⚖ 2. Law Firm Partner Region Pre-tax Annual Salary Post-tax Estimate Equivalent in RMB Madrid €80,000–150,000+ €60,000–90,000 ¥470,000–700,000 Beijing ¥500,000–3,000,000+ Varies ¥500,000 and up ✅ Summary: The income gap in medium-to-large law firms is huge. Beijing has a high ceiling, while Madrid is more stable but harder to break through.\n🏥 3. Attending Physician (Public Hospital) Region Pre-tax Annual Salary Post-tax Estimate Equivalent in RMB Madrid €50,000–70,000 €35,000–49,000 ¥273,000–383,000 Beijing ¥250,000–400,000 Already post-tax ¥250,000–400,000 ✅ Summary: Incomes are similar in both places. Beijing doctors likely earn more in practice due to project commissions and position allowances.\n💻 4. Senior Software Engineer Region Pre-tax Annual Salary Post-tax Estimate Equivalent in RMB Madrid €45,000–65,000 €31,500–45,500 ¥245,700–354,900 Beijing ¥300,000–600,000 Already post-tax ¥300,000–600,000 ✅ Summary: In the internet industry, Beijing is far ahead. Technical positions in Spain often face a “salary ceiling” phenomenon.\n📌 Summary In high-tech fields like education, healthcare, IT, and law, Beijing’s post-tax income is generally on par with or even higher than Madrid’s. Especially in the internet industry, Beijing’s income offers stronger growth potential and flexibility.\n4. Blue-Collar Workers: More Dignified in Madrid, More Frugal in Beijing 👷 Construction Worker Madrid post-tax annual salary: €15,000–20,000 ≈ ¥117,000–156,000 Beijing post-tax annual salary: ¥60,000–96,000 🔌 Plumber/Electrician Madrid post-tax annual salary: €18,000–25,000 ≈ ¥141,000–196,000 Beijing post-tax annual salary: ¥72,000–108,000 🛵 Delivery Driver Madrid post-tax annual salary: €12,000–18,000 ≈ ¥93,000–140,000 Beijing post-tax annual salary: ¥72,000–120,000 🛍 Salesclerk / Cashier Madrid post-tax annual salary: €11,000–16,000 ≈ ¥86,000–125,000 Beijing post-tax annual salary: ¥48,000–84,000 ✅ Summary: For blue-collar jobs, Madrid’s income is generally higher. Spain’s strong labor protection system, high minimum wage, and compliant employment practices make for a more “dignified” overall experience.\n5. Differences in Cost of Living and Convenience 💸 Where is Madrid Expensive? The previous article, “The Downsides of Living in Spain: A Detailed 2024 Comparison of Madrid vs. Beijing”, has already analyzed all aspects of the cost of living in both cities, with a particular focus on a fair comparison of basic necessities and standardized goods. But to truly experience the “pain points” of consumption in Madrid, it’s worth looking at the small details where prices are severely imbalanced. These might better reflect your true feelings about the quality of life:\n“Splurging” at the Arcade: In Madrid, the coin slots at arcades devour shiny 1 Euro coins, which directly translate into game time. Imagine, in Beijing, you only need to pay 1 RMB for a game token, with big discounts for bulk purchases. This “currency unit swap,” where the number is the same but the value is worlds apart, instantly inflates the cost of simple entertainment by nearly 8 times. You might have fun, but your wallet will feel the pain.\n“Astronomical” Prices for Stationery and Toys: The most jaw-dropping difference is the price gap for stationery and toys. In Madrid, you’ll often see a situation where the number on the price tag is the same as in Beijing, but the unit has quietly changed from “RMB” to “Euro.” A common toy that sells for 10 RMB in Beijing is transformed into a €10 item in Madrid, which is a staggering 78 RMB! This shocking price difference of over 8 times turns ordinary daily purchases into a heavy burden.\n🧾 Bureaucratic Efficiency and Convenience 🛠 Slow bureaucracy: Administrative efficiency in Spain is low. 🍱 Fewer and slower food delivery options: Limited platforms, high delivery fees. 🛠 Expensive home services: Workers are hard to book and costly. ✅ Beijing’s “Happiness” Advantages Fast services, comprehensive apps. Convenient food delivery, courier, and life services. Abundant and cost-effective consumer goods. ✅ Conclusion: Do You Want “Dignity” or “Advancement”? Dimension Madrid Beijing High-Paying Industries Stable, with a clear ceiling Competitive, but with greater room for promotion Blue-Collar Work High income, good social security Low income, but costs are manageable Pace of Life Slow-paced, relaxed social life Fast-paced, resource-intensive Efficiency Slow, mostly offline Highly efficient, fully online Consumer Services Expensive labor, fewer product categories, fewer entertainment options Low cost, many choices ✊ Final Words: Where should you settle down? This is not just a choice of a geographical coordinate but a deep consideration of personal values, life stage, and even financial strength. Here, I will set aside subjective impressions and use a series of real, reliable data to present you with an unfiltered Spain, helping you to perceive the true fabric of this nation.\n","wordCount":"1196","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","dateModified":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"/en/income-analysis-for-locals-in-spain-madrid-vs-beijing-who-can-afford-a-more-decent-life/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"zixia","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=/en/ accesskey=h title="zixia (Alt + H)">zixia</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">

But to truly experience the &ldquo;pain points&rdquo; of consumption in Madrid, it&rsquo;s worth looking at the small details where prices are severely imbalanced. These might better reflect your true feelings about the quality of life:</p><ul><li><strong>&ldquo;Splurging&rdquo; at the Arcade:</strong><blockquote><p>In Madrid, the coin slots at arcades devour shiny <strong>1 Euro coins</strong>, which directly translate into game time. Imagine, in Beijing, you only need to pay <strong>1 RMB</strong> for a game token, with big discounts for bulk purchases. This &ldquo;currency unit swap,&rdquo; where the number is the same but the value is worlds apart, instantly inflates the cost of simple entertainment by nearly 8 times. You might have fun, but your wallet will feel the pain.</p></blockquote></li><li><strong>&ldquo;Astronomical&rdquo; Prices for Stationery and Toys:</strong><blockquote><p>The most jaw-dropping difference is the price gap for stationery and toys. In Madrid, you&rsquo;ll often see a situation where the number on the price tag is the same as in Beijing, but the unit has quietly changed from &ldquo;RMB&rdquo; to &ldquo;Euro.&rdquo; A common toy that sells for <strong>10 RMB</strong> in Beijing is transformed into a <strong>€10</strong> item in Madrid, which is a staggering <strong>78 RMB</strong>! This <strong>shocking price difference of over 8 times</strong> turns ordinary daily purchases into a heavy burden.</p></blockquote></li></ul><h3 id=-bureaucratic-efficiency-and-convenience>🧾 Bureaucratic Efficiency and Convenience<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#-bureaucratic-efficiency-and-convenience>#</a></h3><ul><li>🛠 Slow bureaucracy: Administrative efficiency in Spain is low.</li><li>🍱 Fewer and slower food delivery options: Limited platforms, high delivery fees.</li><li>🛠 Expensive home services: Workers are hard to book and costly.</li></ul><h3 id=-beijings-happiness-advantages>✅ Beijing&rsquo;s &ldquo;Happiness&rdquo; Advantages<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#-beijings-happiness-advantages>#</a></h3><ul><li>Fast services, comprehensive apps.</li><li>Convenient food delivery, courier, and life services.</li><li>Abundant and cost-effective consumer goods.</li></ul><hr><h2 id=-conclusion-do-you-want-dignity-or-advancement>✅ Conclusion: Do You Want &ldquo;Dignity&rdquo; or &ldquo;Advancement&rdquo;?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#-conclusion-do-you-want-dignity-or-advancement>#</a></h2><table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:left>Dimension</th><th style=text-align:left>Madrid</th><th style=text-align:left>Beijing</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:left>High-Paying Industries</td><td style=text-align:left>Stable, with a clear ceiling</td><td style=text-align:left>Competitive, but with greater room for promotion</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left>Blue-Collar Work</td><td style=text-align:left>High income, good social security</td><td style=text-align:left>Low income, but costs are manageable</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left>Pace of Life</td><td style=text-align:left>Slow-paced, relaxed social life</td><td style=text-align:left>Fast-paced, resource-intensive</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left>Efficiency</td><td style=text-align:left>Slow, mostly offline</td><td style=text-align:left>Highly efficient, fully online</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left>Consumer Services</td><td style=text-align:left>Expensive labor, fewer product categories, fewer entertainment options</td><td style=text-align:left>Low cost, many choices</td></tr></tbody></table><hr><h2 id=-final-words>✊ Final Words:<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#-final-words>#</a></h2><p>Where should you settle down?
