This is not merely a legend but a symbol of the integration of ancient tribes:\nThe Yellow Emperor’s group: An agricultural tribe from the Central Plains, with the surname Ji; The Yan Emperor’s group: A tribe with the surname Jiang, related to the ancient Qiang people; Chiyou’s group: The Jiuli (Nine Li) tribes, ancestors of the southern Miao-Man peoples. Ultimately, the people of the Yan Emperor and Chiyou were incorporated into the Yellow Emperor’s tribe, forming the “Huaxia.”\n👉 From the very beginning, the Chinese nation was a civilizational community that was pluralistic yet ultimately tended toward unity.\nII. The Origin of “Hua”: Flower and Mount Hua In ancient Chinese, “华” (Huà) and “花” (huā, flower) were homophonous. The flower, symbolizing prosperity, was very likely an early tribal totem.\nMount Hua, revered as the Western Sacred Mountain, is the sacred mountain of the “Hua people.”\nBy the Spring and Autumn period, the Book of Documents, “Completion of the War” already stated:\nAmong the Huaxia and the wild tribes of the north and south, there were none who did not follow and submit.\nThe Zuo Zhuan, “10th Year of Duke Ding” says:\nThe border tribes should not conspire against Xia; the Yi barbarians should not disrupt Hua.\nThis indicates that “Huaxia” had already become the self-identity of the Central Plains civilization.\n👉 The tribal alliance of mythology eventually transformed into a civilizational concept in writing.\nIII. Evidence of the Xia: Yangshao, Longshan, Erlitou, and Liangzhu The Xia Dynasty was long considered a “legendary dynasty.”\nHowever, archaeological discoveries have gradually clarified history:\nYangshao Culture (c. 5000–3000 BC, middle reaches of the Yellow River): Best represented by painted pottery. It was primarily agricultural and formed the basis of the early Huaxia groups in the Central Plains. Longshan Culture (c. 3000–1900 BC, lower reaches of the Yellow River): Characterized by black pottery and the emergence of city sites. Social stratification intensified, and the early form of a state appeared, making it a key stage leading to the Xia. Erlitou Culture (c. 1900–1500 BC, Yanshi, Henan): Featured palaces, roads, and bronze ritual vessels, indicating centralized power. It is widely believed to be associated with the Xia Dynasty and marks the entry of Huaxia into the “state era.” Meanwhile, parallel development occurred in the Yangtze River basin:\nLiangzhu Culture (3300–2300 BC, Zhejiang): Known for its jade civilization. Jade is a unique symbol of Huaxia civilization. Its ritual system and social hierarchy were highly developed, earning it the title “empirical evidence of 5,000 years of Chinese civilization.” Ancient DNA studies show that the paternal lineage of the Liangzhu people was also dominated by the O haplogroup (mostly O1, O2), closely related to the O-M122 of the Central Plains Han people. This indicates that the Liangzhu people were genetically homologous with the people of the Central Plains, but they followed a southern path of civilization. 👉 Conclusion: The Yangshao-Longshan-Erlitou sequence represents the direct lineage of the Xia Dynasty, while Liangzhu represents the peak of southern civilization. The parallel development and eventual confluence of the north and south formed the pluralistic yet unified structure of Huaxia civilization.\nIV. Ancient DNA and the Paternal Lineage Imprint of East Asia Ancient DNA studies show that:\nThe Yangshao-Longshan-Erlitou populations have genetic continuity with modern Han, Tibetan, and Qiang peoples; Components of the Liangzhu culture population still exist in southern Han Chinese and Miao-Yi ethnic groups. Over 70% of modern Han Chinese males belong to the O haplogroup (especially O-M122), which is the core paternal marker of the Han people.\nComparison of Paternal Haplogroups of Major East Asian Ethnic Groups Han Chinese: O haplogroup 70–80%, the most concentrated. Tibetans: O haplogroup 50–60%, with another 35–45% being D-M174 (a remnant of an ancient East Asian indigenous paternal lineage). Qiang: Primarily O haplogroup, continuing ancient Qiang characteristics. Mongols: Primarily C-M217 (50–60%), a typical marker of nomadic peoples. Manchus: Historically similar to Mongols, with C haplogroup being dominant. After entering the Central Plains and long-term intermarriage with Han Chinese, they are now predominantly of the O haplogroup. Japanese: O haplogroup 40–50%, D-M174 30–40%, with a small amount of C. Koreans: O haplogroup 60–70%, with small amounts of C and N. European Comparison: R haplogroup approx. 60–70% (Western Europe dominated by R1b, Eastern Europe by R1a), with I haplogroup (10–20%), and smaller proportions of E/J/G haplogroups. 👉 Conclusion: The Han O haplogroup is the most stable and concentrated. Tibetans and Japanese retain a large amount of the ancient D haplogroup. Mongols and Manchus were once dominated by C but eventually integrated into the larger O haplogroup system.\nV. Han, Tibetan, and Qiang: Same Origin, Different Branches The Han, Tibetan, and Qiang peoples all originate from the ancient Qiang people:\nHan: One branch of the ancient Qiang entered the Yellow River basin, developed agriculture, and merged with the Yangshao-Longshan-Erlitou cultures to form the Han people (O haplogroup 70–80%). Tibetans: Another branch of the ancient Qiang moved onto the Tibetan Plateau, engaged in pastoralism, and merged with the Paleolithic indigenous D-M174 population to form the Tibetan people (O ≈50–60%, D ≈35–45%). Qiang: The Qiang people of today’s Maoxian County in Sichuan (who call themselves “Rma”) are direct descendants of the ancient Qiang. 👉 The Han, Tibetan, and Qiang are brotherly ethnic groups from the same origin but different branches. The Han are the largest branch, while the Tibetans and Qiang retain more ancient genes and unique cultures.\nVI. Genetic Drift: The High Probability of Minority Genes Disappearing Why has the Han O haplogroup persisted for thousands of years, while the genes of other ethnic groups have gradually dissipated?\nThe answer lies in genetic drift.\nGenetic drift refers to:\nMinority genes, having a very low proportion in a population, are susceptible to random fluctuations and have a high probability of disappearing completely after a few generations; Majority genes are more stable and become more established with each passing generation. This is like gamblers in a casino:\nLarge capital (majority genes), even with occasional losses, can still hold on; Small capital (minority genes) can be wiped out and eliminated by just a few fluctuations. Example from Human Evolution All humans today can be traced back to a single father, “Y-chromosomal Adam,” and a single mother, “Mitochondrial Eve.”\nThey were not the only people at the time, but:\nOther bloodlines were gradually absorbed or disappeared through genetic drift; Only their bloodlines continued, becoming the common ancestors of modern humans. Meanwhile, “Homo sapiens’ cousins” like the Neanderthals and Denisovans eventually all went extinct.\n👉 The pattern is clear: in ethnic fusion, minority genes disappear, and majority genes persist.\nVII. Case Studies of Historical Peoples Turkic people: They once had a powerful empire in Central Asia and were the ruling class of Turkey. However, the genes of modern Turkish people have almost no connection to East Asia. The Turkic bloodline has dissipated, leaving only the language. Xiongnu people: They migrated west to Europe and established the “Hunnic Empire,” but modern Hungarians have almost no Xiongnu genes. Manchu people: When they entered the Central Plains during the Qing Dynasty, their paternal lineage was mostly C haplogroup. After three hundred years of integration, the paternal lineage of today’s Manchu people is almost identical to that of the Han, being predominantly O haplogroup. 👉 Historical facts confirm the principle of genetic drift: the genes of minority groups are ultimately absorbed by the majority group.\nVIII. The “Uprising of the Five Barbarians” and the Misconception of Admixture Many people say: After the Uprising of the Five Barbarians, the Han people were long ago completely admixed.\nBut the facts from genetic testing contradict this:\nThe Han O haplogroup still accounts for 70–80%, making it the most stable genetic structure in East Asia; The proportion of other components (C, N, etc.) is extremely low, far from enough to change the main body; Historically, minority ethnic groups were ultimately assimilated by the Han, not the other way around. 👉 The truth is: The Han were not diluted; they were the main body that continuously absorbed others.\nThis is why today’s Han people still maintain a high stability of the O haplogroup.\nIX. Religious Culture: Rationality and Inclusiveness Han culture, like its genetics, exhibits the characteristic of “stability + absorption.”\nShang Dynasty: Revered ghosts and emphasized sacrifices; Zhou Dynasty: The Duke of Zhou established rites, with ancestor worship at the core; Confucianism: Respected ghosts and spirits but kept them at a distance, focusing on human ethics and ritual governance; Han and Tang Dynasties: Buddhism, Daoism, and Confucianism coexisted; Song, Ming, and Qing Dynasties: Clan ancestral halls became deeply rooted at the grassroots level. Characteristics:\nAncestor worship → The combination of bloodline and culture; Rationalization → Religion incorporated into the ritual system; Inclusiveness → Foreign religions could all be absorbed; Secularism → Easy acceptance of science and practice. 👉 The stability of genes and the rational inclusiveness of culture mirror each other.\nX. The True Meaning of the Zhonghua Minzu Linguistics: Chinese, Tibetan, Qiang, and Yi languages → all belong to the Sino-Tibetan language family; Genetics: The Han, Tibetan, and Qiang peoples share the O haplogroup from the ancient Qiang, just in different directions; Historical Culture: The Yan Emperor, Yellow Emperor, Chiyou, and Qiang people → all were ultimately incorporated into Huaxia civilization. 👉 Zhonghua Minzu (Chinese Nation) = The Han people as the main body + a community of multiple minority ethnic groups.\nXI. Conclusion From mythology to archaeology, from genetics to culture, the Han people exhibit a “triple continuity”:\nUnbroken historical culture — 5,000 years of Huaxia, with an uninterrupted cultural lineage; Stable bloodline and genetics — The Han O haplogroup as the backbone, with Tibetans and Qiang from the same origin; Inclusive and rational culture — Foreign religions and cultures were all integrated. The cultural and bloodline inheritance of the Han people has a distinct ethnic character.\nHistorical culture and genetic tracing both prove that:\nThe Han people are the main body of the Zhonghua Minzu, and the Zhonghua Minzu is the civilizational community of China’s multiple ethnic groups.\nOnly by examining from the perspectives of genetics and history can one understand the origin of the Zhonghua Minzu.\n","wordCount":"1738","inLanguage":"zh","datePublished":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","dateModified":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"/en/the-ethnic-nature-of-the-han-people-the-5-000-year-inheritance-of-huaxia-bloodline-and-chinese-culture/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"zixia","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=/zh/ accesskey=h title="zixia (Alt + H)">zixia</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">

genetics</strong> — The Han O haplogroup as the backbone, with Tibetans and Qiang from the same origin;</li><li><strong>Inclusive and rational culture</strong> — Foreign religions and cultures were all integrated.</li></ol><blockquote><p>The cultural and bloodline inheritance of the Han people has a distinct ethnic character.</p><p>Historical culture and genetic tracing both prove
