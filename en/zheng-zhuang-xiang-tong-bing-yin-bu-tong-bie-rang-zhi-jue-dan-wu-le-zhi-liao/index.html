Must be rhinitis.” 🧠 “Coughing? It’s just a cold.” 🧠 “Headache? I’ll just take a painkiller.” And then they start self-diagnosing and self-medicating.\nBut in reality, many different illnesses can present with the exact same symptoms.\nIf you don’t figure out the root cause and only treat the symptoms, it’s not just ineffective—it can make things worse.\n🧪 I Thought It Was Allergic Rhinitis, but It Was Vasomotor Rhinitis—The Treatments Are Completely Different I’m a classic example. Whenever I smell irritants like perfume, cooking fumes, or dust, I immediately get a stuffy nose, start sneezing, and have a runny nose. It’s especially noticeable during large temperature swings between morning and evening or when the air is dry.\nMy subconscious reaction was: “This must be allergic rhinitis.”\nSo, I started using a Japanese nasal spray:\n✅ Sato ナザール Spray 👉 Contains a vasoconstrictor ingredient (naphazoline), which clears the nasal passages within minutes. The effect was magical at first. One spray and I could breathe freely, as if I was “cured.”\nBut problems soon followed:\n😵 Once I stopped using it, the congestion became even worse. My nasal passages were constantly congested and swollen. I couldn’t sleep well at night and struggled to speak during the day.\n🔍 A Check-up Revealed: Not Allergies, but Vasomotor Rhinitis I couldn’t stand it anymore, so I went to the hospital for a series of tests:\n✅ Allergen Skin Prick Test: Negative ✅ IgE Blood Test: Normal The final diagnosis was: Vasomotor Rhinitis (Nonallergic Rhinitis)\n✔️ Not an immune system problem ✔️ Antihistamines are ineffective ✔️ Vasoconstrictor sprays can actually worsen the condition! ⚠️ Vasoconstrictors: Temporary Relief, Long-Term Worsening Common sprays like Sato Nazal, Otrivin, and Ditong Biyan Shui almost all contain vasoconstrictor ingredients (like naphazoline, xylometazoline).\nTheir mechanism of action is:\nRapidly constrict nasal blood vessels → Relieve congestion → Provide temporary relief\nBut what happens after long-term use?\n🚨 The nasal passages become less sensitive to the drug 🚨 Rebound vasodilation occurs after stopping the medication 🚨 “Rebound congestion” appears 🚨 Over time, it develops into “rhinitis medicamentosa” (drug-induced rhinitis) 📄 The Instruction Manual Isn’t Just for Show: Read It Carefully! Many people buy medicine looking only at the claimed effects, without reading the instructions.\nIn fact, the drug’s instruction manual clearly states:\n⚠️ “Do not use continuously for more than 5-7 days” ⚠️ “Limited number of uses per day” ⚠️ “Long-term use can lead to rhinitis medicamentosa” These aren’t just formalities; they are warnings based on clinical experience.\nFast-acting drugs are not a cure and cannot replace a proper long-term treatment plan.\n😷 “A Cold” Is Not a Diagnosis, but a Set of Symptoms “A cold” is everyday language, not a medical diagnosis. When symptoms like coughing, fever, and a runny nose appear, the actual root cause could be one of many things:\n🦠 Viral infections (e.g., rhinovirus, coronavirus) 🧫 Bacterial infections (e.g., streptococcus) 🌬 Allergic reactions (e.g., pollen, dust mites) 🌫 Air irritants (e.g., smog, cold air) Same symptoms, different causes.\nIf you take medicine based solely on the idea that “you have a cold,” you’re very likely taking the wrong one.\n🥶 “You Caught a Chill” ≠ The Real Cause We are too used to saying things like:\n🗣 “Did you catch a cold?” 🗣 “Did you catch a chill?”\nBut you need to know:\n✅ “A cold” is just a collection of symptoms ✅ “Catching a chill” is just a possible trigger ❌ Neither is the root cause itself What is the real cause?\n✔️ Rhinovirus ✔️ Coronavirus ✔️ Influenza virus ✔️ Streptococcus ✔️ Other pathogens “Catching a chill” simply causes a temporary drop in your body’s immunity, opening the “door” for these pathogens.\nSo, it’s not the cold wind that makes you sick; it’s the cold wind that makes it easier for viruses to get in.\n🧩 A Few Examples to Make It Clear: 🚨 Common Symptoms 🧬 Possible Causes Stuffy Nose / Sneezing / Runny Nose Allergic rhinitis, vasomotor rhinitis, viral infection, sinusitis, air irritation Headache Migraine, cervicogenic headache, common cold, cerebral ischemia, anxiety Cough Common cold, bronchitis, asthma, gastroesophageal reflux, allergies Fever Influenza, bacterial infection, autoimmune disease, vaccine reaction Stomach Pain Gastritis, ulcer, Helicobacter pylori infection, anxiety Behind every symptom could be a different disease; you can’t rely on intuition.\n⏱ Many Medications Require a Full “Course of Treatment”—Don’t Stop Just Because You Feel Better! This is another point many people overlook:\n📍 Antibiotics, nasal corticosteroids, antiviral drugs, medications for chronic inflammation… 📍 All require a complete course of treatment, taken according to the prescribed schedule and dosage. ❗️Don’t stop taking the medication just because you “feel a little better” ❗️Don’t switch medications arbitrarily just because you “feel uncomfortable” Otherwise, it can lead to:\nRecurring symptoms A prolonged, unresolved illness Development of drug resistance, making future treatment more difficult Scientific treatment follows a process: “Lab tests → Determine the cause → Treat the cause → See effects → Consolidate → Recover.” Skipping any stage can render all previous efforts useless.\n📚 We Are Entering the Era of “Evidence-Based Medicine” In the past, when seeing a doctor or buying medicine, many people relied on “experience,” “word-of-mouth,” or “what worked for so-and-so.”\nToday, medicine has entered a more scientific era: 👉 Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM)\nWhat does this mean?\n✅ Using real clinical data to guide treatment ✅ Verifying drug efficacy with scientific experiments ✅ Assessing risks with statistical models ✅ Making decisions based on research conclusions, not ‘feelings’ 🧪 Is a Drug Truly Effective? You Can’t Rely on “Hearsay” For a drug to be approved, it must undergo a rigorous medical validation process:\nAnimal studies + Pharmacological mechanism research Phase I-III clinical trials: Including randomization, double-blinding, and control groups Toxicity analysis and long-term observation Pharmacokinetic analysis: Understanding how the drug is absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and excreted in the body In particular, the Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) is the gold standard for testing a drug’s efficacy: neither the doctors nor the patients know who is receiving the drug versus a placebo, ensuring the results are reliable and unbiased.\n🧬 Pharmacological Mechanism + Etiological Research = The Foundation of Precision Treatment Antihistamines target the histamine release mechanism Antibiotics are categorized to attack specific bacteria Antiviral drugs precisely interrupt the viral replication cycle Biologic targeted drugs and immunotherapy drugs directly address the root of cellular pathology This isn’t about “who it worked for in the past,” but about: 📊 Scientific basis + Experimental data + Clear mechanism + Clinical confirmation\n✅ The Correct Approach to Treatment (A Summary) 🔎 Don’t rush to buy medicine as soon as symptoms appear 🧠 Don’t “self-diagnose” based on experience 📋 Instead——\nFind the root cause, don’t just look at the symptoms Get tests done, don’t rely on subjective feelings Follow your doctor’s advice, don’t take medicine randomly Read the instructions: dosage, frequency, and duration are all important Complete the full course of treatment, don’t stop prematurely ✅ Use evidence-based medicine to guide every treatment decision 📌 A Final Word: Next time you say “My rhinitis is acting up again” or “I have a cold,” ask yourself first:\n“Do I really know what illness I have?”\n🧩 Symptoms ≠ Diagnosis 🧩 Appearance ≠ Essence 🧩 Experience ≠ Evidence 🧩 Feeling ≠ Science Using an evidence-based mindset to identify the cause, treat it appropriately, and complete the full course of therapy is how you truly take responsibility for your health.\nIf you know someone who loves to “self-diagnose,” misuse nasal sprays, or stop treatment early, 👉 please forward this article to them.\nFeel free to give this a “Like” 👍 to help more people realize that— experience cannot replace science, intuition cannot replace tests, symptoms cannot hide the truth, and treatment must be based on evidence.\n","wordCount":"1327","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","dateModified":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"/en/zheng-zhuang-xiang-tong-bing-yin-bu-tong-bie-rang-zhi-jue-dan-wu-le-zhi-liao/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"zixia","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=/en/ accesskey=h title="zixia (Alt + H)">zixia</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
