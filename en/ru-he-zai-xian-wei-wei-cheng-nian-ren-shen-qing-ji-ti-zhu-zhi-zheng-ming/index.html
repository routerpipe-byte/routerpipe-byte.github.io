This is the only online method and the fastest, most standardized one.\n📁 I. When Must a “Collective Address Certificate” Be Submitted? A Certificado colectivo must be submitted in the following scenarios:\n✔️ A minor’s residency renewal (The immigration office explicitly requires a colectivo certificate)\n✔️ School registration (new or transfer) School districts are determined based on the family’s address.\n✔️ Applying for or changing a health center for a health card (SIP) To confirm the assigned health district.\n✔️ Subsidy applications Such as childcare benefits, family subsidies, etc.\n🧾 II. Required Documents (Applicable Throughout Spain) The following documents are universally required by all Ayuntamientos (city halls):\n1. Identification for Both Parents (DNI/NIE/TIE) ✔️ Because both parents are considered interesados (interested parties) in the application.\n2. The Minor Child’s Identification (Passport / NIE / TIE) ✔️ The child cannot sign, but their identification must be provided.\n3. Authorization Form (MOD_AUT_PROGENITORS) ✔️ Parents authorize the submission of the application (the child does not need to sign).\n4. Main Application Form (MOD_SOL_AUT_CERT_COL) ✔️ To be filled out with the family’s address and member information.\n5. Proof of Residence (Contract/Bill) Some city halls may request this; it is advisable to have it ready.\n🧭 III. Accessing the Application Portal (Applicable Nationwide) The path is almost always the same:\nSede Electrónica → Catálogo de trámites → Certificado de empadronamiento colectivo\nThe interface may vary slightly between cities, but the process is the same.\n📝 IV. How to Correctly Fill in the “Interesados” (Interested Parties) —This is the key to a successful application! ✔️ 1. You Must List Both Parents (Two Adults) Reasons:\nBoth are adults registered at the address. The system requires all “interesados” to sign. Legally, both parents have custody. This is the fastest method for review and the one most recognized by the immigration office. ❌ 2. Do Not Add the Minor The child cannot sign electronically. If you add them:\nThe system will request the child’s signature. The process will get stuck at “Pendiente de firma” (Awaiting signature). You will have to start the application over. The correct way is: 👉 Upload the child’s identification, but do not add the child as an “interesado”.\n📎 V. Uploading Documents (Envío de documentos) Document Purpose Required? MOD_SOL_AUT_CERT_COL Main application form ✔️ ID for both parents To verify the identity of the adult interested parties ✔️ Child’s ID (Passport/NIE/TIE) To verify the minor’s information ✔️ MOD_AUT_PROGENITORS Parental authorization form ✔️ Contract/Bill Supporting proof Optional Once finished, click Siguiente.\n✍️ VI. Electronic Signature (Firma) —Both Parents Must Sign Separately Go to:\nPaso 5 – Firma\n✔️ Step 1: One Parent Signs First Select your digital certificate:\nCertificado digital de persona física de [Name]\nClick Firmar → The system will display:\nInstancia firmada correctamente\n✔️ Step 2: The Other Parent Must Also Sign (Do Not Skip This) Two methods to switch digital certificates:\n🔧 Method A: Close the Browser → Log In Again with the Other Person’s Certificate to Sign Close all browser windows. Reopen the browser. Go to Consulta de sus trámites. Click Firma. Use the other parent’s digital certificate → Signature complete. 🧩 Method B (Recommended): Chrome Profiles This is the most stable method and prevents account conflicts:\nIn Chrome, go to the top right corner → “Add”. Create a new browser profile for the second parent. Open the city hall website in the new profile. Go to Firma → Complete the second signature. ⏳ VII. Processing Time: Usually 1–3 Business Days to Receive the Certificate After successful submission, the city hall’s review speed is typically:\n✔️ Normal: 24–72 hours (1–3 business days) This is the typical speed in places like L’Eliana, Valencia, and Madrid.\n✔️ Peak Season: 3–5 days (e.g., before school starts in September) 📬 How to Receive the Result Method 1: Email Notification It will be sent to the email address (Correo electrónico) provided by the applicant. It may come with a PDF attached or a download link.\nMethod 2: Online Download Go to:\nConsulta de sus trámites → Carpeta ciudadana → Descargar\nThe PDF file will contain:\nAll family members (including the minor) Address Registration and issuance dates The city hall’s electronic seal It is generally valid for 90 days.\n🧷 VIII. Special Note for Residency Renewal (Renovación) If you are renewing a minor’s residency:\n✔️ You must submit a collective address certificate (colectivo). ✔️ You must upload the child’s identification. ✔️ Both parents must complete the electronic signature. These are strict requirements from the immigration office.\n🎯 IX. Summary (The 3 Most Important Points) 1️⃣ List only the parents as “interesados,” not the minor. 2️⃣ Both parents must sign separately using their own digital certificates. 3️⃣ Since children don’t have digital certificates, the only way to get their address certificate online is through the “collective address certificate” method.\nTherefore:\n🟢 Adults can get their certificate instantly online. 🟢 Minors must use the method described in this article to apply online. 🟢 You can get the PDF file in 1–3 business days without visiting the city hall. This is currently the most time-saving, effective, and standardized method available throughout Spain.\nSpain’s e-government services are quite comprehensive; things like fishing licenses, address certificates, address updates, tax payments, digital certificate renewals, traffic fines, and administrative penalty appeals can all be handled online.\n","wordCount":"1047","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","dateModified":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"/en/ru-he-zai-xian-wei-wei-cheng-nian-ren-shen-qing-ji-ti-zhu-zhi-zheng-ming/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"zixia","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=/en/ accesskey=h title="zixia (Alt + H)">zixia</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
