📚 School Hours and Tuition Differences

Spanish Public Schools: School hours are from 9:00–14:00, with 4 classes per day, and are free of charge.
Spanish Private and International Schools: School hours are typically from 9:00–16:00, with 6 classes per day.

The median tuition for private schools is approximately €6,000/year (about 50,000 RMB).
International schools cost around €8,000/year (about 70,000 RMB).
There are significant variations based on grade level, region, and school, with costs potentially differing by 1-2 times.



🏫 Teaching Staff and Pedagogical Features

Teacher absenteeism is relatively high in Spain. A doctor&rsquo;s note for sick leave has legal force and can be issued over the phone for paid sick leave.
Primary schools generally use a &ldquo;generalist&rdquo; system, where a single teacher teaches multiple subjects like English, math, humanities, science, art, and physical education, limiting subject-specific expertise.
Subject-specific teaching only begins in middle school.
The saying &ldquo;the gym teacher taught my math&rdquo; is not a joke in Spain but a result of the generalist system in primary schools.
Exam scores are not ranked.

🈯 Language of Instruction and Multilingual Environment

International schools primarily use English for instruction;
Private and public schools mainly use Spanish;
Autonomous communities like Valencia and Catalonia require the study of local languages;
In middle school, a second foreign language such as French or German is added, making the multilingual workload heavy.

📖 Workload and Holiday Schedule

There is less homework after school.
The academic year is divided into three terms, with a total of about 160–180 teaching days.
Holidays are long.

🇨🇳 Comparison with Basic Education in China

Public Schools: School hours are from 8:00–16:00, with 6–8 classes per day, free of charge, with some regions offering after-school extension classes.
Private/International Schools: 8:00–17:30, with evening self-study sessions starting in middle school, which do not exist in Spain.

Private: Approximately 60,000 RMB/year
International: Approximately 180,000 RMB/year


The academic year is divided into two semesters, with more than 190 teaching days.

🏟️ Disparity in Campus Facilities

International schools in China often have campuses of over 100 acres, featuring heated swimming pools, theaters, multimedia libraries, maker labs, Olympic-standard stadiums, and even equestrian fields, golf courses, and drone and robotics labs.
In contrast, Spanish schools are modest and compact, with simple facilities.

In contrast, Spanish schools are modest and compact, with simple facilities. 📘 Curriculum and Difficulty Many people believe that primary school math in China is much more difficult than abroad, but this is a long-standing misconception.\nFirst, let’s look at age. Spanish children start school younger. The enrollment standard in Spain is based on the calendar year of birth, starting from January 1st, unlike in China where students must be six years old by the start of the school year on September 1st. Therefore, Chinese students in the same grade are, on average, about 9 months older than their Spanish counterparts, with a maximum possible age gap of 1 year and 9 months.\nSecond, Spanish math textbooks introduce fractions from the first grade of primary school, whereas Chinese primary schools only begin to introduce the concept of fractions in the third grade. The A-Level math curriculum in the final year of high school already includes calculus.\nAlthough Western math curricula surpass Chinese ones in breadth and depth, their teaching arrangements have clear shortcomings: fewer classes, more holidays, and faster-paced lectures that rely more on students’ self-understanding and absorption. In contrast, Chinese math education is more solid in terms of class scheduling and systematic explanation, making it suitable for learners who need clear steps and continuous practice.\nOf course, the math content taught in international schools in China is consistent with that in the West; the comparison above was made using public school math curricula.\n🎓 IB Score Comparison Spain: King’s College Madrid (2024): 36 points (highest in the country) Agora Lledo (highest in the Valencia region): 33.5 points Mas Camarena (ranked first overall in Spain): 32 points China: Shanghai Pinghe School: 40 points Shanghai World Foreign Language Middle School (WFLMS): 39 points At least a dozen international schools have an average IB score higher than 36 (Spain’s highest average IB score). 🎯 Top University Admissions Comparison King’s College Madrid (2023): Out of approximately 100 graduates, only 4 G5 offers were received (1 Cambridge, 1 Imperial, 1 LSE, 1 UCL), with no Oxford offers. The G5 acceptance rate is no more than 4% (as one student may receive multiple offers). Chinese Schools: Shanghai Pinghe School (2025): 6 offers from Oxford and Cambridge, with a 77% G5 acceptance rate. Shenzhen College of International Education (SCIE) (2025): UK applications: 330 applicants, 41 pre-offers from Oxbridge, 409 pre-offers from G5 universities. US applications: 210 applicants, 18 offers from Ivy League/Top 10 universities, 243 offers from Top 30 universities. 📌 Core Conclusions International schools in China have significantly higher IB and A-Level scores, giving them an advantage when applying to top UK and US universities. Even ethnic Chinese with Spanish nationality are still considered ‘East Asian’ in diversity-based admissions, where scores remain the decisive factor. 🧭 Recommendations on Choosing an Education System Spain: Offers a relaxed education, abundant holidays, and is suitable for families wanting to cultivate specializations in soccer, tennis, or cycling, and a rich language environment. Achieving excellent academic results requires very strong self-study and self-discipline skills. China: Strong in exam preparation, fast-paced, and more suitable for families aiming for top universities and driven by academic achievement. 📢 Additional Thoughts: Is Exam-Oriented Education Valuable? Some criticize Chinese-style education as an “exam-oriented” system that produces “high scores but low ability” and is too “involuted” (hyper-competitive).\n“Exam-oriented” is not inherently a pejorative term. The essence of this approach is to achieve good results in standardized tests like the Gaokao (National College Entrance Examination), which is precisely one of the fairest forms of competition in Chinese society today. It provides an opportunity for ordinary people, especially children from common or lower-class backgrounds, to change their destiny and achieve upward social mobility.\nIn the admission systems of many top Western universities, grades are often not the sole criterion. A student’s “profile” is highly valued—things like family background, being a golf tournament champion, or volunteering in Africa often become bonus points for children from wealthy families. This competition in “soft power” invisibly widens the gap at the starting line, creating another form of unfairness.\nUnder China’s Gaokao system, however, anyone who is hardworking and outstanding enough can enter a top university based on merit. Excelling in the Gaokao is not achievable through mere rote memorization; it is built on a deep understanding and flexible application of knowledge.\nStarting from scratch in the early 1980s, China rapidly accumulated undeniable technological, military, and economic power, second only to the United States. Unlike the US, which relies on an immigrant-based talent structure—where over half of its Nobel laureates in science are immigrants, and business magnates like Musk, Jobs, Brin, and Huang are also immigrants—China’s progress has been entirely dependent on the engineering and technical talent cultivated by its domestic education system.\nToday, Chinese individuals account for over half of the senior researchers in the AI field; China has its own space station; and it has become the “world’s factory.” All of this stems from an education system that continuously produces a large volume of outstanding talent.\nWithout competition, without “involution,” it would be impossible to cultivate a large-scale pool of engineering and technical talent, and the country’s rapid development would not have occurred. The reason European countries can “lie flat” today is that they are relying on the centuries of accumulated advantages from their ancestors.\nSpain was once the world’s first “empire on which the sun never sets.” Spanish is still the second most spoken native language globally, with about 595 million speakers, second only to Chinese. However, Spain itself has a population of only about 47 million. Its national decline is precisely because its society has gradually become more relaxed, and its golden age is over.\nAt the beginning of the last century, China was still a semi-feudal, semi-colonial society\n","wordCount":"1346","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","dateModified":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"/en/a-comprehensive-comparison-of-basic-education-in-spain-the-truth-chinese-parents-should-know/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"zixia","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=/en/ accesskey=h title="zixia (Alt + H)">zixia</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">

The enrollment standard in Spain is based on the calendar year of birth, starting from January 1st, unlike in China where students must be six years old by the start of the school year on September 1st. Therefore, Chinese students in the same grade are, on average, about 9 months older than their Spanish counterparts, with a maximum possible age gap of 1 year and 9 months.</p><p>Second, Spanish math textbooks introduce fractions from the first grade of primary school, whereas Chinese primary schools only begin to introduce the concept of fractions in the third grade. The A-Level math curriculum in the final year of high school already includes calculus.</p><p>Although Western math curricula surpass Chinese ones in breadth and depth, their teaching arrangements have clear shortcomings: fewer classes, more holidays, and faster-paced lectures that rely more on students&rsquo; self-understanding and absorption. In contrast, Chinese math education is more solid in terms of class scheduling and systematic explanation, making it suitable for learners who need clear steps and continuous practice.</p><p>Of course, the math content taught in international schools in China is consistent with that in the West; the comparison above was made using public school math curricula.</p><h3 id=-ib-score-comparison>🎓 IB Score Comparison<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#-ib-score-comparison>#</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Spain:</strong><ul><li>King’s College Madrid (2024): 36 points (highest in the country)</li><li>Agora Lledo (highest in the Valencia region): 33.5 points</li><li>Mas Camarena (ranked first overall in Spain): 32 points</li></ul></li><li><strong>China:</strong><ul><li>Shanghai Pinghe School: 40 points</li><li>Shanghai World Foreign Language Middle School (WFLMS): 39 points</li><li>At least a dozen international schools have an average IB score higher than 36 (Spain&rsquo;s highest average IB score).</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id=-top-university-admissions-comparison>🎯 Top University Admissions Comparison<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#-top-university-admissions-comparison>#</a></h3><ul><li><strong>King’s College Madrid (2023):</strong> Out of approximately 100 graduates, only 4 G5 offers were received (1 Cambridge, 1 Imperial, 1 LSE, 1 UCL), with no Oxford offers.

Achieving excellent academic results requires very strong self-study and self-discipline skills.</li><li><strong>China</strong>: Strong in exam preparation, fast-paced, and more suitable for families aiming for top universities and driven by academic achievement.</li></ul><h3 id=-additional-thoughts-is-exam-oriented-education-valuable>📢 Additional Thoughts: Is Exam-Oriented Education Valuable?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#-additional-thoughts-is-exam-oriented-education-valuable>#</a></h3><p>Some criticize Chinese-style education as an &ldquo;exam-oriented&rdquo; system that produces &ldquo;high scores but low ability&rdquo; and is too &ldquo;involuted&rdquo; (hyper-competitive).</p><p>&ldquo;Exam-oriented&rdquo; is not inherently a pejorative term. The essence of this approach is to achieve good results in standardized tests like the Gaokao (National College Entrance Examination), which is precisely one of the fairest forms of competition in Chinese society today. It provides an opportunity for ordinary people, especially children from common or lower-class backgrounds, to change their destiny and achieve upward social mobility.</p><p>In the admission systems of many top Western universities, grades are often not the sole criterion. A student&rsquo;s &ldquo;profile&rdquo; is highly valued—things like family background, being a golf tournament champion, or volunteering in Africa often become bonus points for children from wealthy families. This competition in &ldquo;soft power&rdquo; invisibly widens the gap at the starting line, creating another form of unfairness.</p><p>Under China&rsquo;s Gaokao system, however, anyone who is hardworking and outstanding enough can enter a top university based on merit. Excelling in the Gaokao is not achievable through mere rote memorization; it is built on a deep understanding and flexible application of knowledge.</p><p>Starting from scratch in the early 1980s, China rapidly accumulated undeniable technological, military, and economic power, second only to the United States. Unlike the US, which relies on an immigrant-based talent structure—where over half of its Nobel laureates in science are immigrants, and business magnates like Musk, Jobs, Brin, and Huang are also immigrants—China&rsquo;s progress has been entirely dependent on the engineering and technical talent cultivated by its domestic education system.</p><p>Today, Chinese individuals account for over half of the senior researchers in the AI field; China has its own space station; and it has become the &ldquo;world&rsquo;s factory.&rdquo; All of this stems from an education system that continuously produces a large volume of outstanding talent.</p><p>Without competition, without &ldquo;involution,&rdquo; it would be impossible to cultivate a large-scale pool of engineering and technical talent, and the country&rsquo;s rapid development would not have occurred. The reason European countries can &ldquo;lie flat&rdquo; today is that they are relying on the centuries of accumulated advantages from their ancestors.</p><p>Spain was once the world&rsquo;s first &ldquo;empire on which the sun never sets.&rdquo; Spanish is still the second most spoken native language globally, with about 595 million speakers, second only to Chinese. However, Spain itself has a population of only about 47 million. Its national decline is precisely because its society has gradually become more relaxed, and its golden age is over.</p><p>At the beginning of the last century, China was still a semi-feudal, semi-colonial society</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul></footer></article></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2026 <a href=/en/>zixia</a></span> ·
