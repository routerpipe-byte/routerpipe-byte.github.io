Spanish schools, in contrast, are modest and compact, with simple facilities. 📘 Curriculum and Difficulty Many people believe that Chinese primary school math is much harder than in other countries, but this is a long-standing misconception.\nFirst, let’s look at age. Spanish children start school earlier. This is because Spain’s admission standard is based on the calendar year (starting from January 1st), unlike China, which requires children to be six years old by the start of the school year on September 1st. Therefore, on average, Chinese students in the same grade are about 9 months older than their Spanish counterparts, with a maximum possible age gap of 1 year and 9 months.\nSecond, Spanish math textbooks introduce fractions from the first grade of primary school, whereas Chinese primary schools only begin teaching fractions in the third grade. In the final year of high school, A-Level math courses already cover calculus.\nAlthough the breadth and depth of Western math curricula far exceed those of China, their teaching structure has clear shortcomings: fewer classes, more holidays, and faster-paced lectures that rely more on students’ self-understanding and absorption. In contrast, Chinese math education is more solid in terms of class hours and systematic instruction, making it suitable for learners who need clear steps and continuous practice.\nOf course, international schools in China teach the same math content as in the West; the comparison above is only between public school curricula.\n🎓 IB Score Comparison Spain: King’s College Madrid (2024): 36 (highest in the country) Agora Lledo (highest in the Valencia region): 33.5 Mas Camarena (ranked #1 overall in Spain): 32 China: Shanghai Pinghe School: 40 Shanghai World Foreign Language Middle School (WFLMS): 39 At least a dozen international schools have an average IB score higher than 36 (Spain’s highest average IB score). 🎯 Top University Admissions Comparison King’s College Madrid (2023): Out of about 100 graduates, only 4 G5 offers were received (1 Cambridge, 1 Imperial, 1 LSE, 1 UCL), with no Oxford offers. The G5 acceptance rate is no more than 4% (as one student may receive multiple offers). Chinese Schools: Shanghai Pinghe School (2025): 6 offers from Oxford and Cambridge, G5 acceptance rate of 77%. Shenzhen College of International Education (SCIE) (2025): UK applications: 330 applicants, 41 conditional offers from Oxbridge, 409 conditional offers from G5 universities. US applications: 210 applicants, 18 offers from Ivy League/Top 10 universities, 243 offers from Top 30 universities. 📌 Core Conclusions International schools in China achieve significantly higher IB and A-Level scores, giving them an advantage when applying to top UK and US universities. Even Chinese descendants with Spanish citizenship are still considered ‘East Asian’ in diversity-focused admissions, where scores remain the decisive factor. 🧭 Recommendations for Choosing an Education System Spain: Offers a relaxed education, abundant holidays, and is suitable for families wanting to cultivate specialties in soccer, tennis, or cycling, and for its language environment. Achieving excellent academic results requires very strong self-learning and self-discipline. China: Strong in test-taking skills, fast-paced, and more suitable for families aiming for top universities and driven by academic achievement. 📢 Additional Thoughts: Is Exam-Oriented Education Valuable? Some criticize Chinese-style education as an “exam-oriented” system that produces “high scores but low ability” and is too hyper-competitive (“involution”).\n“Exam-oriented” is not inherently a negative term. The essence of being exam-oriented is to strive for good results in standardized tests like the Gaokao (National College Entrance Examination), which is precisely one of the fairest forms of competition in Chinese society today. It provides an opportunity for ordinary people, especially children from common or lower-class backgrounds, to rewrite their destinies and achieve upward social mobility.\nIn the admission systems of many top Western universities, grades are often not the sole criterion. A student’s “background” is highly valued—such as family background, a golf championship title, or volunteer experience in Africa—which often becomes a bonus for children from wealthy families. This competition in “soft power” invisibly widens the gap at the starting line, creating another form of unfairness.\nUnder China’s Gaokao system, anyone, as long as they are hardworking and excellent enough, can enter a top university based on their own merit. Excelling in the Gaokao is not achievable through rote memorization alone; it is built on a deep understanding and flexible application of knowledge.\nStarting from scratch in the early 1980s, China has rapidly accumulated undeniable world-second-ranking technological, military, and economic power, second only to the United States. Unlike the US, which relies on an immigrant-based talent structure—where over half of its Nobel laureates in science are immigrants, and business giants like Musk, Jobs, Brin, and Jensen Huang are also immigrants—China’s progress is entirely dependent on the engineering and technical talent cultivated by its own domestic education system.\nToday, Chinese individuals account for over half of the senior researchers in the field of AI; China has its own space station; it has become the “world’s factory.” All of this stems from the continuous stream of outstanding talent produced by its education system.\nWithout competition, without “involution,” it’s impossible to cultivate a large-scale pool of engineering and technical talent, and the nation’s rapid development would not have been possible. The reason European countries can “lie flat” today is because of the centuries of accumulated advantages from their ancestors.\nSpain was once the world’s first “empire on which the sun never sets.” Spanish is still the second most spoken native language globally, with about 595 million speakers, second only to Mandarin Chinese. However, Spain itself has a population of only about 47 million. Its national decline is precisely because its society as a whole gradually relaxed, and its golden age passed.\nAt the beginning of the last century, China was still a semi-feudal, semi-colonial\n","wordCount":"1339","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","dateModified":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"/en/a-comprehensive-comparison-of-basic-education-in-spain-the-truth-chinese-parents-should-know/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"zixia","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=/en/ accesskey=h title="zixia (Alt + H)">zixia</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">

Spanish children start school earlier. This is because Spain&rsquo;s admission standard is based on the calendar year (starting from January 1st), unlike China, which requires children to be six years old by the start of the school year on September 1st. Therefore, on average, Chinese students in the same grade are about 9 months older than their Spanish counterparts, with a maximum possible age gap of 1 year and 9 months.</p><p>Second, Spanish math textbooks introduce fractions from the first grade of primary school, whereas Chinese primary schools only begin teaching fractions in the third grade. In the final year of high school, A-Level math courses already cover calculus.</p><p>Although the breadth and depth of Western math curricula far exceed those of China, their teaching structure has clear shortcomings: fewer classes, more holidays, and faster-paced lectures that rely more on students&rsquo; self-understanding and absorption. In contrast, Chinese math education is more solid in terms of class hours and systematic instruction, making it suitable for learners who need clear steps and continuous practice.</p><p>Of course, international schools in China teach the same math content as in the West; the comparison above is only between public school curricula.</p><h3 id=-ib-score-comparison>🎓 IB Score Comparison<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#-ib-score-comparison>#</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Spain:</strong><ul><li>King’s College Madrid (2024): 36 (highest in the country)</li><li>Agora Lledo (highest in the Valencia region): 33.5</li><li>Mas Camarena (ranked #1 overall in Spain): 32</li></ul></li><li><strong>China:</strong><ul><li>Shanghai Pinghe School: 40</li><li>Shanghai World Foreign Language Middle School (WFLMS): 39</li><li>At least a dozen international schools have an average IB score higher than 36 (Spain&rsquo;s highest average IB score).</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id=-top-university-admissions-comparison>🎯 Top University Admissions Comparison<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#-top-university-admissions-comparison>#</a></h3><ul><li><strong>King’s College Madrid (2023):</strong> Out of about 100 graduates, only 4 G5 offers were received (1 Cambridge, 1 Imperial, 1 LSE, 1 UCL), with no Oxford offers.

Achieving excellent academic results requires very strong self-learning and self-discipline.</li><li><strong>China</strong>: Strong in test-taking skills, fast-paced, and more suitable for families aiming for top universities and driven by academic achievement.</li></ul><h3 id=-additional-thoughts-is-exam-oriented-education-valuable>📢 Additional Thoughts: Is Exam-Oriented Education Valuable?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#-additional-thoughts-is-exam-oriented-education-valuable>#</a></h3><p>Some criticize Chinese-style education as an &ldquo;exam-oriented&rdquo; system that produces &ldquo;high scores but low ability&rdquo; and is too hyper-competitive (&ldquo;involution&rdquo;).</p><p>&ldquo;Exam-oriented&rdquo; is not inherently a negative term. The essence of being exam-oriented is to strive for good results in standardized tests like the Gaokao (National College Entrance Examination), which is precisely one of the fairest forms of competition in Chinese society today. It provides an opportunity for ordinary people, especially children from common or lower-class backgrounds, to rewrite their destinies and achieve upward social mobility.</p><p>In the admission systems of many top Western universities, grades are often not the sole criterion. A student&rsquo;s &ldquo;background&rdquo; is highly valued—such as family background, a golf championship title, or volunteer experience in Africa—which often becomes a bonus for children from wealthy families. This competition in &ldquo;soft power&rdquo; invisibly widens the gap at the starting line, creating another form of unfairness.</p><p>Under China&rsquo;s Gaokao system, anyone, as long as they are hardworking and excellent enough, can enter a top university based on their own merit. Excelling in the Gaokao is not achievable through rote memorization alone; it is built on a deep understanding and flexible application of knowledge.</p><p>Starting from scratch in the early 1980s, China has rapidly accumulated undeniable world-second-ranking technological, military, and economic power, second only to the United States. Unlike the US, which relies on an immigrant-based talent structure—where over half of its Nobel laureates in science are immigrants, and business giants like Musk, Jobs, Brin, and Jensen Huang are also immigrants—China&rsquo;s progress is entirely dependent on the engineering and technical talent cultivated by its own domestic education system.</p><p>Today, Chinese individuals account for over half of the senior researchers in the field of AI; China has its own space station; it has become the &ldquo;world&rsquo;s factory.&rdquo; All of this stems from the continuous stream of outstanding talent produced by its education system.</p><p>Without competition, without &ldquo;involution,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s impossible to cultivate a large-scale pool of engineering and technical talent, and the nation&rsquo;s rapid development would not have been possible. The reason European countries can &ldquo;lie flat&rdquo; today is because of the centuries of accumulated advantages from their ancestors.</p><p>Spain was once the world&rsquo;s first &ldquo;empire on which the sun never sets.&rdquo; Spanish is still the second most spoken native language globally, with about 595 million speakers, second only to Mandarin Chinese. However, Spain itself has a population of only about 47 million. Its national decline is precisely because its society as a whole gradually relaxed, and its golden age passed.</p><p>At the beginning of the last century, China was still a semi-feudal, semi-colonial</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul></footer></article></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2026 <a href=/en/>zixia</a></span> ·
