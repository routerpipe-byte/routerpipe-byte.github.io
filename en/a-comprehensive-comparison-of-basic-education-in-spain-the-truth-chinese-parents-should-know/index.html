📚 School Hours and Tuition Differences

Spanish Public Schools: School hours are from 9:00 AM to 2:00 PM, with 4 classes per day. They are free of charge.
Spanish Private and International Schools: School hours are typically from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM, with 6 classes per day.

The median tuition for private schools is approximately €6,000/year (about 50,000 RMB).
International schools cost around €8,000/year (about 70,000 RMB).
There are significant variations based on grade level, region, and school, with costs potentially differing by a factor of 1-2.



🏫 Teaching Staff and Pedagogical Features

Teacher absenteeism is relatively high in Spain. A doctor&rsquo;s note for sick leave has legal standing and can be issued over the phone for paid sick leave.
Primary schools generally use a &ldquo;generalist&rdquo; system, where a single teacher teaches multiple subjects like English, math, humanities, science, art, and physical education, which may limit subject-specific expertise.
Subject-specific teaching only begins in secondary school.
The saying &ldquo;the gym teacher taught my math&rdquo; is not a joke in Spain but a result of the generalist system in primary schools.
Exam scores are not ranked.

🈯 Language of Instruction and Multilingual Environment

International schools primarily use English for instruction.
Private and public schools mainly use Spanish.
Autonomous communities like Valencia and Catalonia require students to learn the local regional language.
In secondary school, a second foreign language such as French or German is added, making the multilingual workload demanding.

📖 Workload and Holiday Schedule

There is less homework.
The academic year is divided into three terms, with a total of about 160–180 teaching days.
Holidays are long.

🇨🇳 Comparison with Basic Education in China

Public Schools: School hours are from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM, with 6–8 classes per day. They are free, with some areas offering after-school care programs.
Private/International Schools: 8:00 AM to 5:30 PM, with evening self-study sessions starting in middle school, which do not exist in Spain.

Private: Approx. 60,000 RMB/year
International: Approx. 180,000 RMB/year


The academic year is divided into two semesters, with over 190 teaching days.

🏟️ Disparity in Campus Facilities

International schools in China often boast campuses of over 100 acres, featuring heated swimming pools, theaters, multimedia libraries, maker labs, Olympic-standard stadiums, and even equestrian centers, golf courses, and drone and robotics labs.
In contrast, Spanish schools are more modest and compact, with simpler facilities.

In contrast, Spanish schools are more modest and compact, with simpler facilities. 📘 Curriculum and Difficulty Many people believe that primary school math in China is much harder than abroad, but this is a long-standing misconception.\nFirst, let’s look at age. Spanish children start school earlier. The admission standard in Spain is based on the calendar year of birth (starting from January 1st), unlike in China, where a child must be six years old by the start of the school year on September 1st. Therefore, on average, Chinese students in the same grade are about 9 months older than their Spanish counterparts, with a maximum possible age gap of 1 year and 9 months.\nSecond, Spanish math textbooks introduce fractions from the first grade of primary school, whereas Chinese schools only begin teaching fractions in the third grade. The A-Level math curriculum in the final year of high school already includes calculus.\nAlthough Western math curricula often have greater breadth and depth than those in China, their teaching structure has clear shortcomings: fewer classes, more holidays, and faster-paced instruction that relies more on students’ self-study and absorption. In contrast, Chinese math education is more robust in terms of class hours and systematic explanation, making it suitable for learners who need clear steps and continuous practice.\nOf course, the math content taught in international schools in China is consistent with Western standards; the comparison above is only between public school curricula.\n🎓 IB Score Comparison Spain: King’s College Madrid (2024): 36 (highest in the country) Agora Lledo (highest in the Valencia region): 33.5 Mas Camarena (ranked #1 overall in Spain): 32 China: Shanghai Pinghe School: 40 Shanghai World Foreign Language Middle School (Shìwài): 39 At least a dozen international schools have an average IB score higher than 36 (Spain’s highest average). 🎯 Top University Admissions Comparison King’s College Madrid (2023): Around 100 graduates, received only 4 G5 offers (1 Cambridge, 1 Imperial, 1 LSE, 1 UCL), no Oxford. The G5 acceptance rate is no more than 4% (as one student might receive multiple offers). Chinese Schools: Shanghai Pinghe School (2025): 6 offers from Oxford and Cambridge, G5 acceptance rate of 77% Shenzhen College of International Education (SCIE) (2025): UK applications: 330 applicants, 41 Oxbridge pre-offers, 409 G5 pre-offers US applications: 210 applicants, 18 Ivy League/Top 10 offers, 243 Top 30 offers 📌 Core Conclusions International schools in China achieve significantly higher IB and A-Level scores, giving them an advantage in applying to top UK and US universities. Even ethnic Chinese students with Spanish nationality are still considered “Asian” in diversity-focused admissions, where scores remain the decisive factor. 🧭 Recommendations for Choosing an Education System Spain: Offers a relaxed education, long holidays, and is suitable for families wanting to cultivate specializations in sports like football, tennis, or cycling, and a multilingual environment. Achieving excellent academic results requires strong self-learning and self-discipline. China: Strong in test preparation, fast-paced, and better suited for families aiming for top universities and driven by academic achievement. 📢 Additional Thought: Is Test-Oriented Education Valuable? Some criticize Chinese-style education as a “test-oriented” system that produces “high scores but low ability” and is overly competitive (“involution”).\n“Test-oriented” is not inherently a negative term. Its essence is to achieve good results through standardized exams like the Gaokao, which is one of the fairest systems of competition in Chinese society today. It provides an opportunity for ordinary people, especially those from humble or lower-class backgrounds, to change their destiny and achieve upward social mobility.\nIn the admissions systems of many top Western universities, grades are often not the sole criterion. A student’s “profile”—such as family background, a golf championship title, or volunteer experience in Africa—is highly valued, often becoming a bonus for children from wealthy families. This competition in “soft power” invisibly widens the gap at the starting line, creating another form of unfairness.\nUnder China’s Gaokao system, however, anyone who is hardworking and talented enough can enter a top university based on merit. Excelling in the Gaokao is not achievable through rote memorization alone; it is built on a deep understanding and flexible application of knowledge.\nStarting from scratch in the early 1980s, China has rapidly accumulated undeniable technological, military, and economic power, second only to the United States. Unlike the US, which relies on an immigrant-based talent structure (over half of its Nobel laureates in science are immigrants, and business giants like Musk, Jobs, Brin, and Huang are also immigrants or children of immigrants), China’s progress has been driven entirely by engineering and technical talent cultivated by its domestic education system.\nToday, Chinese individuals account for over half of the senior researchers in the AI field. China has its own space station and has become the “world’s factory.” All of this stems from an education system that continuously produces a large volume of outstanding talent.\nWithout competition, without “involution,” it would be impossible to cultivate a large-scale workforce of engineers and technicians, and the country would not have experienced such rapid development. The reason European countries can afford to “lie flat” today is because they are living off the accumulated advantages their ancestors built over centuries.\nSpain was once the world’s first “empire on which the sun never sets.” Spanish is still the second most spoken native language globally, with about 595 million speakers, second only to Mandarin Chinese. However, Spain itself has a population of only about 47 million. Its national decline is precisely because its society gradually became more relaxed, and its golden age ended.\nAt the beginning of the last century, China was still a semi-feudal, semi-colonial\n","wordCount":"1336","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","dateModified":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"/en/a-comprehensive-comparison-of-basic-education-in-spain-the-truth-chinese-parents-should-know/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"zixia","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=/en/ accesskey=h title="zixia (Alt + H)">zixia</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">

Spanish children start school earlier. The admission standard in Spain is based on the calendar year of birth (starting from January 1st), unlike in China, where a child must be six years old by the start of the school year on September 1st. Therefore, on average, Chinese students in the same grade are about 9 months older than their Spanish counterparts, with a maximum possible age gap of 1 year and 9 months.</p><p>Second, Spanish math textbooks introduce fractions from the first grade of primary school, whereas Chinese schools only begin teaching fractions in the third grade. The A-Level math curriculum in the final year of high school already includes calculus.</p><p>Although Western math curricula often have greater breadth and depth than those in China, their teaching structure has clear shortcomings: fewer classes, more holidays, and faster-paced instruction that relies more on students&rsquo; self-study and absorption. In contrast, Chinese math education is more robust in terms of class hours and systematic explanation, making it suitable for learners who need clear steps and continuous practice.</p><p>Of course, the math content taught in international schools in China is consistent with Western standards; the comparison above is only between public school curricula.</p><h3 id=-ib-score-comparison>🎓 IB Score Comparison<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#-ib-score-comparison>#</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Spain:</strong><ul><li>King’s College Madrid (2024): 36 (highest in the country)</li><li>Agora Lledo (highest in the Valencia region): 33.5</li><li>Mas Camarena (ranked #1 overall in Spain): 32</li></ul></li><li><strong>China:</strong><ul><li>Shanghai Pinghe School: 40</li><li>Shanghai World Foreign Language Middle School (Shìwài): 39</li><li>At least a dozen international schools have an average IB score higher than 36 (Spain&rsquo;s highest average).</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id=-top-university-admissions-comparison>🎯 Top University Admissions Comparison<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#-top-university-admissions-comparison>#</a></h3><ul><li><strong>King’s College Madrid (2023):</strong> Around 100 graduates, received only 4 G5 offers (1 Cambridge, 1 Imperial, 1 LSE, 1 UCL), no Oxford.

Achieving excellent academic results requires strong self-learning and self-discipline.</li><li><strong>China</strong>: Strong in test preparation, fast-paced, and better suited for families aiming for top universities and driven by academic achievement.</li></ul><h3 id=-additional-thought-is-test-oriented-education-valuable>📢 Additional Thought: Is Test-Oriented Education Valuable?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#-additional-thought-is-test-oriented-education-valuable>#</a></h3><p>Some criticize Chinese-style education as a &ldquo;test-oriented&rdquo; system that produces &ldquo;high scores but low ability&rdquo; and is overly competitive (&ldquo;involution&rdquo;).</p><p>&ldquo;Test-oriented&rdquo; is not inherently a negative term. Its essence is to achieve good results through standardized exams like the Gaokao, which is one of the fairest systems of competition in Chinese society today. It provides an opportunity for ordinary people, especially those from humble or lower-class backgrounds, to change their destiny and achieve upward social mobility.</p><p>In the admissions systems of many top Western universities, grades are often not the sole criterion. A student&rsquo;s &ldquo;profile&rdquo;—such as family background, a golf championship title, or volunteer experience in Africa—is highly valued, often becoming a bonus for children from wealthy families. This competition in &ldquo;soft power&rdquo; invisibly widens the gap at the starting line, creating another form of unfairness.</p><p>Under China&rsquo;s Gaokao system, however, anyone who is hardworking and talented enough can enter a top university based on merit. Excelling in the Gaokao is not achievable through rote memorization alone; it is built on a deep understanding and flexible application of knowledge.</p><p>Starting from scratch in the early 1980s, China has rapidly accumulated undeniable technological, military, and economic power, second only to the United States. Unlike the US, which relies on an immigrant-based talent structure (over half of its Nobel laureates in science are immigrants, and business giants like Musk, Jobs, Brin, and Huang are also immigrants or children of immigrants), China&rsquo;s progress has been driven entirely by engineering and technical talent cultivated by its domestic education system.</p><p>Today, Chinese individuals account for over half of the senior researchers in the AI field. China has its own space station and has become the &ldquo;world&rsquo;s factory.&rdquo; All of this stems from an education system that continuously produces a large volume of outstanding talent.</p><p>Without competition, without &ldquo;involution,&rdquo; it would be impossible to cultivate a large-scale workforce of engineers and technicians, and the country would not have experienced such rapid development. The reason European countries can afford to &ldquo;lie flat&rdquo; today is because they are living off the accumulated advantages their ancestors built over centuries.</p><p>Spain was once the world&rsquo;s first &ldquo;empire on which the sun never sets.&rdquo; Spanish is still the second most spoken native language globally, with about 595 million speakers, second only to Mandarin Chinese. However, Spain itself has a population of only about 47 million. Its national decline is precisely because its society gradually became more relaxed, and its golden age ended.</p><p>At the beginning of the last century, China was still a semi-feudal, semi-colonial</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul></footer><div class=comments><script src=https://giscus.app/client.js data-repo=routerpipe-byte/routerpipe-byte.github.io data-repo-id=R_kgDORGxuaA data-category="zixia Comments" data-category-id=DIC_kwDORGxuaM4C15FB data-mapping=pathname data-strict=0 data-reactions-enabled=1 data-emit-metadata=0 data-input-position=bottom data-theme=preferred_color_scheme data-lang=en crossorigin=anonymous async></script></div></article></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2026 <a href=/en/>zixia</a></span> ·
