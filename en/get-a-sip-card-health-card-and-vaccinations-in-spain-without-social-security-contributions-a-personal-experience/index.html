SIP is the personal identification card for the Spanish healthcare system, short for “Sistema de Información Poblacional”.\nWith this card, you can:\nVisit public hospitals or community health centers; Get various vaccines provided by the state (including flu, COVID-19, etc.); Receive discounts on prescription medications; Keep a record of your vaccinations and medical history. 🪪 1. What kind of SIP card can you get without social security? For foreigners who are not working and do not contribute to social security (such as those with non-lucrative visas, students, or accompanying parents), you can apply for a temporary SIP card “without healthcare coverage (sin cobertura sanitaria)”.\nThis type of SIP card will be marked with “PRIVAD,” which means you are temporarily not covered by national health insurance for reimbursement, but it can be used for vaccinations and emergency medical services.\n📍My card says:\nSin cobertura sanitaria – Pública gratuita vacunación y urgencias (Without healthcare coverage, free vaccination and emergency services)\nThis type of SIP card is permanently valid; as long as your information doesn’t change, you don’t need to renew it annually.\n📍 2. Where to apply? Go directly to the Centro de Salud (community health center) in your residential area.\nFor example, in my town:\nCentre de Salut L’Eliana Address: Av. del Parc, 3 Opening hours: Monday to Friday 8:00–20:00 (SIP application hours: Monday to Friday 9:45–13:30)\nThe red sign at the entrance clearly states:👇\nConselleria de Sanitat Universal i Salut Pública Generalitat Valenciana\n🧾 3. Required Documents The staff only asked for the following three items:\n✅ Passport or NIE (residence card) ✅ Proof of address (empadronamiento, also known as padrón) ✅ Phone number, email address No social security or private health insurance required.\nAs long as you are a resident, you can register and get a SIP number.\n🪙 4. Application Process 1️⃣ Go to the front desk of the health center and say:\n“Hola, quiero solicitar una tarjeta SIP.” (Hello, I would like to apply for a SIP card.)\n2️⃣ The staff will check your ID and address information.\n3️⃣ After a few minutes, they will print out a temporary paper SIP card on the spot (white paper with red text).\n4️⃣ If you have a residence card or long-term residency proof, you can apply for a formal plastic card.\nThe whole process was very fast; I got mine in about 10 minutes.\n💉 5. Vaccination Process (Flu + COVID-19) In the Valencian Community, a unified “Flu + COVID-19 Vaccination Campaign” starts in mid-October every year.\nThis year’s (2025) poster says:\n🗓 Dates: October 16 to November 30 🕒 Monday, Thursday, Friday 10:00–13:00 🕓 Specific dates in the afternoon 15:00–18:00 📍 Location: Centre de Formación de Personas Adultas, L’Eliana (Av. del Parque, 3)\nThe key point is—\nNo requiere cita previa (No appointment needed) Just bring your SIP card!\nThe atmosphere on-site is very relaxed. Volunteers and nurses will help you with registration and vaccination.\nOne flu shot, one COVID-19 shot, all done in a few minutes.\nThe elderly, patients with chronic diseases, children, and foreign residents can all get vaccinated for free.\n🧍‍♀️ 6. On-site Experience The vaccination site was set up at the municipal adult education center. The queue wasn’t long, about a 20-minute wait, mostly elderly people.\nThe nurses were very skilled.\n💬 A nurse on-site specifically emphasized:\n“As long as you have a SIP card, you can get vaccinated, regardless of whether you contribute to social security.”\n💬 7. Frequently Asked Questions Q\u0026A Q1: My SIP card says “PRIVAD.” Can I get vaccinated? ✅ Yes! This type of card specifically allows for free vaccinations.\nQ2: Does the temporary SIP card have an expiration date? ⏳ There is no fixed expiration date. It remains valid as long as your information doesn’t change.\nQ3: Can I apply without a padrón (address registration)? ❌ No. The padrón is the only proof that you live in the area, and it is mandatory. If you have a personal digital certificate, you can apply for and print it for free directly from the city hall’s website of your registered location, saving you a trip. For minors, parents can use their digital certificate to apply on their behalf under the collective residence certificate section on the city hall’s website. Approval takes about 1-3 business days, after which you can download the PDF certificate, all for free.\nQ4: Can I bring my child to get vaccinated? 👧 Yes, children can also get their own SIP card. You just need to bring their NIE and padrón (proof of address); the child does not need to be present.\n❤️ 8. Conclusion In Spain, even if you don’t have a job or contribute to social security, as long as you are a resident, you can access basic public health services.\nSo don’t hesitate—grab your passport and proof of address and head to your nearest health center to get a SIP card!\nNot only can you get vaccinated, but it also creates a convenient record for future medical care.\n📌 Summary of Practical Information:\nItem Information Application Location Centre de Salut (community health center) Required Documents Passport/NIE + padrón (proof of address) Social Security Required? ❌ No Appointment Needed? ❌ No Available Vaccines Flu / COVID-19 / Childhood vaccines, etc. Cost Free Eligible Population All residents in Spain (including foreigners) ","wordCount":"947","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","dateModified":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"/en/get-a-sip-card-health-card-and-vaccinations-in-spain-without-social-security-contributions-a-personal-experience/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"zixia","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=/en/ accesskey=h title="zixia (Alt + H)">zixia</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
