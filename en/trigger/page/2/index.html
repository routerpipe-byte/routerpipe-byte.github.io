“Chinese people aren’t as beautiful as white people.” “Chinese people have always been uncivilized.” “The Chinese diet is too eclectic.” “Our language lacks class; it’s not as sophisticated as English.”

When many people feel unwell, their first reaction is to judge based on experience:
🧠 “Stuffy nose? Must be rhinitis.” 🧠 “Coughing? It’s just a cold.” 🧠 “Headache? I’ll just take a painkiller.” And then they start self-diagnosing and self-medicating.
But in reality, many different illnesses can present with the exact same symptoms.

The Yellow Emperor’s group: An agricultural tribe from the Central Plains, with the surname Ji; The Yan Emperor’s group: A tribe with the surname Jiang, related to the ancient Qiang people; Chiyou’s group: The Jiuli tribe, ancestors of the Miao-Man peoples of the south.

But here’s the question: Are there really turtles that have lived for a thousand years?
Many people see a giant turtle or tortoise and exclaim, “Wow, this one must be hundreds of years old!” While such claims might “sound plausible,” they actually don’t stand up to the slightest scrutiny.

The imperial examination system wasn’t just about the eight-legged essay; it originally balanced arts and sciences.
The foundation of Han civilization’s belief system is reason and ethics, not theocracy.

Many people think the ancient imperial examinations only tested the eight-legged essay, and that scholars were all “bookworms.” But the truth is quite the opposite. For a long time, the true imperial examination system was a “balance of arts and sciences.” Ancient China was not just a land of poetry, books, rites, and music, but also a civilization that revered science and reason.

Europe did not suddenly learn republicanism; it had long lived with the political experience that “a republic could exist.”
In Europe, the republic was never a fleeting moment of inspiration, but an institutional tradition spanning more than two thousand years.
