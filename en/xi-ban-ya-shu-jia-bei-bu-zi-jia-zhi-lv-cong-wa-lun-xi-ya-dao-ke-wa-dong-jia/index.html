This journey offered a mix of cities, ancient castles, mountains, the sea, and delicious food. We were a group of four, and this article shares all the details of our trip for anyone who might find it useful.\nDay 1｜Valencia → Zaragoza Accommodation: Casa Palacio de Los Sitios ¥772.67 (1 night, 1 double bed + 2 single beds, no breakfast) Sightseeing: Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar + Old Bridge + Ebro River Restaurant: Restaurante Nola Gras, an award-winning, high-value restaurant. There’s a parking lot and an M supermarket across the street. Its signature dishes are the Russian caviar salad and the molten cheesecake, perfect for those who love exploring authentic local cuisine. Day 2｜Zaragoza → Olite Accommodation: Hotel Alda Castillo de Olite ¥1117.47 (1 night, 1 double bed + 2 single beds, no breakfast) Sightseeing: Royal Palace of Olite (Palacio Real de Olite), considered one of the most luxurious castles of the Middle Ages. Built in the 13th-14th centuries, it has over 300 rooms, a Moorish-style courtyard, and notably, an ice well for storing food. It’s great for an in-depth visit and photography. Day 3｜Olite → Bilbao Accommodation: NH Collection Villa de Bilbao ¥2200 (2 standard rooms, no meals) Booked for 12:30 PM: Visit to the Guggenheim Bilbao Museum (Guggenheim Bilbao Museoa, €13 ticket, closed on Mondays, recommend at least 2 hours) Sightseeing: Walk along the Nervion River to enjoy the city scenery. The flower dog sculpture (Puppy) and the 9-meter-tall giant spider sculpture at the entrance of the Guggenheim Museum are must-see landmarks. Zubizuri Bridge, beautiful at night, with a flower market on weekends. The train station by the river also offers a great night view. Txabarri Palace (Txabarri Jauregia), a yellow-green palace with distinctive architecture, very close to the museum. Arriaga Theatre, elegant in style. Boat Tour (City Hall—Deusto Canal—Portugalete Bridge—Getxo—Santurtzi Fishing Port), a fun way to see the sights from the water. Biscay Bridge (Bizkaiko Zubia), a UNESCO World Heritage site. A red iron bridge with a cable car ride for just €1. Food: Cafe Iruna, an old establishment from 1903, part bar, part restaurant. The grilled lamb skewers and various tapas are very popular. Reservations are needed for dinner, but tapas can be ordered anytime. The vintage decor is great for photos. Mio basque urban food, rated 4.7. The onsen egg with mushrooms and foie gras, steak, and cheesecake with a scoop of blueberry ice cream are all recommended. Basque Cheesecake, a local specialty available in rich (fuerte) and mild (suave) flavors. Cantoki jatetxea, rated 4.9, near Cruces station on Line 2. Unfortunately, we couldn’t get a reservation. Goizeko Izarra steakhouse and La Casita de Sabino fish restaurant were closed on Sunday, so we couldn’t try them. Gaztelugatxe (Dragonstone) was on our way, but unfortunately, tickets were sold out. I specifically set an alarm for 2:55 PM to try and grab any remaining same-day tickets (Ticket website: https://www.tiketa.eus/gaztelugatxe/).\nDay 4｜Bilbao → Santander Accommodation: Silken Rio Santander ¥2800 (2 rooms, breakfast included) Booked for 10:30 AM: Visit to the Magdalena Palace (Palacio de la Magdalena), finishing at 11:15 AM. Tickets are €6. Open on Sundays from 10:45 AM to 1:00 PM. Plan for 1-2 hours. The palace is located on a headland in a royal park with stunning scenery. Attractions: Centro Botín: Drove by for a quick look without stopping. Modern exterior. Maritime Museum (Museo Marítimo), €8 ticket, open 10:00 AM–6:00 PM on Sundays. Worth a visit if you’re interested in maritime culture. Parque Marino de la Magdalena beach park, has sea lions, great for photos. Cabárceno Nature Park (Entrada este cabarceno), suitable for families. Restaurants: Taberna la Radio, a 20-year-old local seafood restaurant. The ambiance is average, but the seafood is fantastic. Five-star value for money. Restaurante La Gruta de Jose (The Cave Restaurant), near the pier and Centro Botín, rated 4.7. Unfortunately, we couldn’t get a reservation. Comillas: El Capricho de Gaudí, €7 ticket, open 10:30 AM–7:30 PM on Sundays. This building is a representative work from when Gaudí was 30. The owner was a wealthy, artistic bachelor. The garden is full of blooming hydrangeas (July-September). Palacio de Sobrellano, €5 ticket, open 10:00 AM–3:30 PM on Sundays. Next to it is a cultural center. The blue-patterned gate is very photogenic. These two attractions are very close and share a medium-sized free parking lot, which also has free public restrooms, making it very convenient. Restaurant: El Remedio, an exquisite seaside restaurant located between Santander and Comillas. An old house, a church, a garden, and a cliffside beach. Rated 4.6, especially recommended in the summer. Day 5-6｜Santander → Covadonga (2 nights) Accommodation: HOTEL CERRO LA NINA, €837 for 2 nights (approx. ¥6600), a mountaintop hotel with stunning views. Attraction 1: Mirador de Entrelagos (Lakes of Covadonga). Requires taking a special bus into the mountains for €8 per person. There are mainly 2 lakes and 1 old mine, suitable for a 2-3 hour hike. Attraction 2: The pink-walled Basilica of Covadonga, free entry. The special bus stop is nearby. Not far away is the Holy Cave (Santa Cueva), built into a cave, with a mystical atmosphere. Cangas de Onís: This is the largest town near Covadonga, where you can eat, stay, and stock up on supplies. It’s also the starting point for the special bus. The environment is beautiful, with a market on weekends. Main attraction: The Roman Bridge with its cross. The bridge itself is average, but it’s famous for its religious significance. Hotel Santa Cruz (3-star): Located on the edge of town, nice environment, small rooms, soundproofing unknown. Restaurant 3 is right across the street, and the town center and the stone bridge are within walking distance. Restaurants: La Madreñería, signature dish is Cachopo (a breaded beef fillet stuffed with ham, peppers, and white asparagus). The portion is huge, so it’s recommended to order only a half portion. La Sifonería, vintage decor, blue chairs, and great food. Restaurante Villa María, a manor restaurant that was booked for a wedding, so we couldn’t try it. Special Experience: Take the road uphill from the front of Restaurant 3 to enter a pristine village. It’s a pastoral scene with narrow roads. There are wild chestnuts (abundant in October, sweet but some may have worms). Highly recommended. Day 7｜Covadonga → Salamanca (via Ávila) Accommodation: Melia Las Claras Boutique Hotel Salamanca Sightseeing: University of Salamanca, one of the oldest in the world. Look for the frog sculpture, which is said to bring academic success. Salamanca Cathedral (ticket required). Both the exterior and interior are incredibly photogenic, especially the mysterious astronaut carving. You can climb the tower for a panoramic view of the city, but the stairs are steep, so those with a fear of heights should be cautious. Plaza Mayor, one of the most beautiful squares in Spain. It’s surrounded by cafes and restaurants where you can sunbathe and enjoy a meal. There are often performances in the square, making it very lively. The architecture and sculptures are also great for photos. Casa de las Conchas, a small, exquisite two-story building that houses a public library with a small courtyard for resting. The shell carvings are very distinctive and a must-see for photos. La Clerecía Church, the ticket to the top is only €3.25. From the top, you can see all of Salamanca. There are very few tourists, making it an excellent spot for photos. Strolling through the university and the old town feels like stepping back in time to an ancient European academic institution. Ávila (passing through): Known as the ‘City of Stones’ and ‘City of Saints,’ it was listed as a World Heritage site in 1985. At an altitude of 1131 meters, it is the highest provincial capital in Spain. Medieval City Walls (Muralla Medieval): The best-preserved in Europe, 2.5 km long, with 6 gates, 88 towers, and about 2500 merlons. You can access the walls from the Puerta del Alcázar, Puerta de la Lealtad, and Puerta del Carmen. Ávila Cathedral: Has a fortress-like appearance, a mix of Gothic and Baroque styles. The reliquary in the main altarpiece is a highlight. Basilica of San Vicente, a 12th-century Romanesque building containing the cenotaph of the martyr Saint Vincent and his family. The tomb’s decorations depict scenes from their lives. Royal Monastery of Saint Thomas (Real Monasterio de Santo Tomás): A 15th-century Isabelline Gothic style building, with the tomb of Prince Juan as a highlight. Convent of Saint Teresa (Convento de Santa Teresa): Built on the site of her birthplace, it features a Baroque and Neoclassical style church, an orchard, and a museum. Los Cuatro Postes: Located 2 km from the city, beside the Salamanca highway, it’s the best spot for panoramic photos of Ávila. Day 8-9｜Madrid (2 nights) Accommodation: Woohoo Rooms Fuencarral, no meals, ¥2204.33/2 nights, 1 double bed + 2 single beds Excellent location in the center of Madrid, making it easy to walk or take the metro to major attractions and food streets.\nDay 10｜Madrid → Cuenca → Valencia On the last day, we drove to the cliff city of Cuenca. We had lunch at a restaurant next to the Hanging Houses in Cuenca’s old town, overlooking the gorge and taking photos. After lunch, we drove back to Valencia, concluding our northern Spain road trip.\nTrip Tips Book tickets and popular restaurants in advance, especially for places like Gaztelugatxe, museums, and Gaudí’s Capricho, which sell out quickly in peak season. Most attractions and restaurants have associated parking or free public restrooms. The two main attractions in Comillas sharing a free parking lot was particularly convenient. There’s a large temperature difference between day and night in the highlands and mountains, so bring a jacket. Walking shoes are a must. For food, try local restaurants and old shops; highly-rated small eateries often hold pleasant surprises.
