In response, I no longer rush to explain. Instead, I smile and ask back: “Do you drink milk? Do you eat veal?”\nThis isn’t just about differences in dietary habits; it’s a game of moral hypocrisy and the power of discourse.\n1. The Bloody Truth Behind Milk: The Hidden “Systemic Cruelty” The Western protection of dogs stems from an emotional projection—dogs are family. However, this overflowing love vanishes without a trace when faced with industrial farming.\nTake milk, a staple for Westerners. Have you ever wondered why dairy cows produce milk continuously? Because they must be constantly artificially inseminated, pregnant, and giving birth. The logic behind this is utterly cruel: for humans to drink milk, the newborn calves (especially males), unable to produce milk and prized for their tender meat, are often sent to the slaughterhouse shortly after birth to become the expensive delicacy on the dinner table—veal.\nThis is the true meaning of “devouring everything”: plundering the mother’s milk and consuming the child’s flesh.\nIn comparison, is this industrialized process really more civilized than “eating dogs”? This is the Western logical trap: whatever pleases humans and provides emotional value (like dogs) is a “friend”; whatever is silent and provides nutritional value (like cows) is an “industrial raw material.”\nThis isn’t humanism; it’s a “species pageant”—the cute ones get immunity, the plain-looking ones deserve to be eaten.\n2. A Historical Dislocation: The Survival Logic of Agricultural vs. Nomadic Civilizations Let’s return to a historical perspective. China is a classic agricultural civilization. For thousands of years, what was truly “sacred and inviolable” was the cow, not the dog.\nIn an era without tractors, cattle were the nation’s strategic lifeline. The protection of cattle in Chinese laws throughout history was far stricter than Westerners can imagine: • As early as the pre-Qin and Han dynasties: The Book of Rites stipulated that “feudal lords shall not kill cattle without cause.” By the Han dynasty, privately slaughtering a plow ox could even cost you your life. • In prosperous times like the Tang Dynasty: The Tang Code explicitly stated that killing a cow was punishable by one and a half years of penal servitude. • As recently as the Qing Dynasty: Even in the last feudal dynasty closest to modern times, the Great Qing Legal Code still strictly mandated: privately slaughtering one’s own plow ox resulted in one hundred strokes of the cane and three years of penal servitude.\nThis means that for thousands of years, eating beef in China was not only immoral but also a crime.\nIn contrast, dogs in traditional society played the role of watchdogs and a supplementary food source. The famous Han dynasty general Fan Kuai started his career as a “dog butcher,” and Liu Bang (the founding emperor of the Han dynasty) consumed dog meat. This was as natural at the time as Westerners eating beef.\nIf you demand a worldwide ban on dog meat because you treat dogs as pets, should Indians, who revere cows as sacred, then accuse you of “blasphemy” for eating steak? Should Muslims, who consider pigs unclean, despise you for eating bacon as “filthy and vile”?\nThe true arrogance lies in not only setting your own standards but also forcing the entire world to live by them.\n3. Aesthetics and Value: Who Defines “Civilized” and “Barbaric”? This cultural double standard is not just present at the dinner table; it permeates the very definitions of aesthetics and values.\nInterestingly, ancient Chinese were no strangers to “high noses, deep-set eyes, blonde hair, and blue eyes”—but those were the features of figures like Zhong Kui and door gods. In traditional Han Chinese cognition, these features were associated with “warding off evil” due to their intimidating appearance, even carrying a certain “non-human” or demonic connotation. Traditional Chinese beauty, on the other hand, was the solemn grace of the Dunhuang flying apsaras, the subtle charm in Lin Daiyu’s phoenix eyes, or the plump elegance of Tang dynasty court ladies.\nYet today, under the wash of Western cultural hegemony, the features of a door god have become the standard for “international supermodels,” while original Eastern charm has become “unconventional.” This follows the same logic as the “eating dogs” issue: the West holds the power of definition. They define what is “beautiful,” so monolids become a flaw to be corrected. They define what is “civilized,” so eating dog meat becomes barbaric, while force-feeding geese for foie gras and separating mother cows from their calves becomes “culinary culture.”\n4. Conclusion: Refuse to Be Judged I personally do not eat dog meat because I am influenced by modern pet culture. But I will defend to the death the dietary freedom of my compatriots, provided it is done without cruelty and within legal and regulatory compliance.\nSo the next time someone asks you, “Do Chinese people eat dogs?” please don’t feel ashamed or rush to explain that “only a small number of people do.” You can calmly tell them: “The beauty of the world lies in its diversity. In China, we respect the labor of the cow; in the West, you cherish the companionship of the dog. But please don’t stand on a moral high ground looking down on everyone while slicing your veal. What’s often being devoured isn’t the dog, but humanity’s most basic reason and tolerance.”\n","wordCount":"963","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2026-02-05T13:20:00Z","dateModified":"2026-02-05T13:20:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"/en/do-chinese-people-eat-dogs-the-arrogance-and-double-standards-of-western-civilization/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"zixia","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=/en/ accesskey=h title="zixia (Alt + H)">zixia</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
