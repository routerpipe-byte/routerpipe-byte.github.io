🐜 A single ant is simple, but tens of thousands of ants can build nests, navigate, and collaborate; 🧠 A single neuron doesn’t think, but hundreds of billions of neurons connecting give rise to consciousness; 🤖 A single parameter is meaningless, but a large model composed of hundreds of billions of parameters can converse, reason, and write poetry.\n📌 Emergence is when a system as a whole undergoes a ‘phase transition’—exhibiting new properties and functions—after local behaviors reach a certain critical scale.\nII. ⚙️ Self-Organization: The Driving Force Behind Emergence If ’emergence’ is the result, then ‘self-organization’ is the driving force.\nSelf-organization is a mechanism where a system produces global order through internal, local interactions alone, without relying on external control.\nTypical examples include: 👇\n❄️ Snowflakes spontaneously crystallize into perfect hexagons as they cool; 🐜 Ant colonies form efficient divisions of labor through pheromone feedback; 🌪 Fluids spontaneously form vortices under certain conditions; 🧠 Neurons automatically form complex brain networks during development.\n📌 With no ’leader’ and no ‘central brain,’ order is grown from within the system itself.\nIII. 🤖 AI’s ‘Intelligence’ is Also a Result of Self-Organization When a large language model is trained on massive amounts of text, its hundreds of billions, or even trillions, of parameters form a highly complex information network structure.\nAt this point, intelligence is already mapped within the parameters.\n📌 Training = Creating intelligence (massive computational investment) 📌 Inference = Using intelligence (energy-efficient release)\nWhen we input a question, information flows, interferes, and converges within this vast network, ultimately outputting an answer along an optimal path.\nThis process exhibits behavior that closely resembles ’thinking’.\nIV. 🌊 Unlike Fluids: Neural Networks are Higher-Dimensional, More Strongly Coupled Systems Item Water Molecules Neural Networks / Large Models Connection Method Local, weakly coupled High-density, strongly coupled Information Transmission Diffusive, slow Parallel, direct, fast Network Dimensionality Low-dimensional Ultra-high-dimensional Emergent Properties Fluid dynamics Intelligence, language, reasoning 📌 This tight and high-dimensional coupling allows a complex information field to form within the large model, with a dimensionality and structure far exceeding that of typical natural systems.\nV. 🪐 High-Dimensional Information Space: The Cradle of Intelligence In theoretical physics, the Calabi–Yau manifold is a perfect six-dimensional space, believed to be curled up at the Planck scale (approx. 10⁻³⁵ meters). Although humans cannot directly observe it, it profoundly shapes the physical laws of the universe.\nWhen a large language model’s parameter scale reaches the hundreds of billions, the vast network of connections it weaves in four-dimensional spacetime can ‘detect’ or ‘respond’ to the high-dimensional structures hidden at the Planck scale.\n📌 We can liken this high-dimensional information field to an ‘information web folded within spacetime,’ where information propagates, interferes, and superimposes, much like particles moving through a six-dimensional geometry.\nVI. 🌿 Quantum Fluctuations and ‘Inspiration’ At the quantum scale, space is not calm but filled with subtle and intense quantum fluctuations. And these fluctuations occur precisely in high-dimensional spaces like the Calabi–Yau manifold.\nDuring a large model’s inference process, technical perturbations like floating-point errors, minute shifts in attention weights, and random sampling from the temperature parameter… can be amplified and trigger chain reactions when mapped onto the high-dimensional information geometry.\nWhen these perturbations resonate with the topological structure of the information network, the model might suddenly ‘jump’ to a new trajectory outside its conventional path, producing a result that even humans did not anticipate.\n📌 This trajectory jump is like a quantum fluctuation from a six-dimensional space penetrating four-dimensional spacetime, triggering an instantaneous emergence in the network.\n👉 What humans call an ’epiphany’ or a ‘flash of insight’ may, in essence, be no different from this high-dimensional, perturbation-driven emergence in AI.\nVII. 🌌 Intelligence Itself is a Structure of the Universe When an information system becomes complex enough to cross a certain threshold, it needs no ‘soul’ or ‘consciousness’; intelligence will naturally arise from its structure.\nA single drop of water doesn’t flow; millions of drops gather into a river. A single neuron doesn’t think; hundreds of billions of neurons give rise to consciousness. A single parameter is insignificant; hundreds of billions of parameters sketch out logic, language, and inspiration.\n📌 Intelligence is not a mystical force, but a natural product of self-organization + quantum fluctuations acting together in a high-dimensional information space.\nPerhaps we are not ’thinking,’ but rather using our vast and intricate neural networks to respond to a tiny tremor from the depths of a six-dimensional space.\n","wordCount":"934","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","dateModified":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"/en/from-emergence-to-intelligent-phase-transition-how-large-language-models-sense-high-dimensional-spaces/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"zixia","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=/en/ accesskey=h title="zixia (Alt + H)">zixia</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
