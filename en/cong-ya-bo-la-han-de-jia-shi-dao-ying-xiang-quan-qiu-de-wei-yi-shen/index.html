The ancient Greeks, on the other hand, raised a bunch of “superpowered man-children” on Mount Olympus. Zeus and his family, besides not doing any real work, were busy having affairs and bickering every day.\nBut eventually, a more efficient and monopolistic business model stood out:\nMonotheism\nThe logic is extremely self-consistent— there’s only one “Big Boss” in the heavens, and the mortal world only needs one “CEO.”\nAnd the founder of this monopolistic enterprise was—Abraham (also known as Ibrahim).\nI. A Family Feud: The Soap Opera That Changed Geopolitics All major world-changing events might have started simply because—\nThe first wife couldn’t have children.\nAbraham was a successful entrepreneur, but he had a secret problem: his first wife, Sarah, was infertile.\nSo—\nHe had his first son with the handmaiden Hagar: Ishmael. Later, his first wife miraculously became pregnant and gave birth to a second son: Isaac. To avoid a family inheritance dispute, Hagar and her son were exiled to the desert.\nThis “dispute between the legitimate and illegitimate sons” became the most expensive family separation in human history:\nIsaac (the legitimate second son) → Became the ancestor of the Jewish people → And incidentally, produced Moses and Jesus among his descendants. Ishmael (the illegitimate first son) → Became the ancestor of the Arab people → And from his descendants emerged the Prophet Muhammad. A miraculous scientific coincidence: Modern genetics (Y-chromosome haplogroups) has surprisingly confirmed this legend—\nJewish people are predominantly J2. Arab people are predominantly J1. These two groups indeed shared the same “father” 4000 years ago.\nSo it turns out, the earth-shattering conflict in the Middle East today is essentially just two brothers fighting over the inheritance of their ancestral home.\nII. Product Iteration: The History of “Re-skinning” from 1.0 to 3.0 Although the family split, the underlying code of the three brothers is actually the same.\nThe evolution of these three major religions is, in essence, the continuous upgrading of the same piece of software.\nJudaism | Bedrock Edition 1.0 Core: The Old Testament A VIP, invitation-only product The Jewish people see themselves as God’s “exclusive beta testers.” Arrogant, exclusive, and generally doesn’t accept new users. Christianity | International Promotion Edition 2.0 Jesus appeared.\nAs “God’s spokesperson,” he transformed the product from “Jewish-exclusive” to “globally universal.”\n⚠️ Here comes the key point:\nJesus himself never wrote a single word.\nThe New Testament we see today is a “memoir” written by his followers decades later.\nThis means: from its inception, Christianity has been a history of interpretation.\nIslam | Ultimate Patch 3.0 Muhammad believed:\nThe previous two versions were ruined by “product managers.”\nSo he directly released the final revised edition—the Quran.\nA grand “localization” scene:\nAbraham → Ibrahim Jesus → Isa Mary → Maryam The logic is simple:\nMy big brothers misinterpreted the scriptures; I’m here to set the record straight.\nIII. The Art of Interpretation: How Did Polygamy “Disappear”? Since the scripts are so similar, why are people’s ways of life so different?\nThe answer is just one sentence:\nThe text is dead, but the right to interpret it is alive.\nTake “polygamy” for example.\nMany people think this is a “perk” of a certain religion, but its originator is actually Judaism.\nIn Exodus 21:10, God even thoughtfully laid out a “guide to taking concubines”:\n“If he takes another wife to himself, he shall not diminish her food, her clothing, or her marital rights.”\nKing Solomon married 700 wives, and God didn’t fire him.\nSo why do Christians practice monogamy now?\nChristianity’s “survival instinct” In order to spread the faith in the Roman Empire, which practiced monogamy, they directly used the power of interpretation to forcibly change the rules. Judaism’s “going with the flow” It wasn’t until around 1000 AD that polygamy was formally abolished. The scripture hasn’t changed. The CEO, in order to adapt to the market, made a breach-of-contract interpretation of a thousands-of-years-old agreement.\n","wordCount":"693","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","dateModified":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"/en/cong-ya-bo-la-han-de-jia-shi-dao-ying-xiang-quan-qiu-de-wei-yi-shen/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"zixia","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=/en/ accesskey=h title="zixia (Alt + H)">zixia</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
