📚 School Hours and Tuition Differences Spanish Public Schools: School hours are from 9:00 AM to 2:00 PM, with 4 classes per day. They are free of charge. Spanish Private and International Schools: School hours are typically from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM, with 6 classes per day. The median tuition for private schools is approximately €6,000/year (about 50,000 RMB). International schools cost around €8,000/year (about 70,000 RMB). There are significant variations based on grade level, region, and school, with costs potentially differing by a factor of 1-2. 🏫 Teaching Staff and Pedagogical Features Teacher absenteeism is relatively high in Spain. A doctor’s note for sick leave has legal standing and can be issued over the phone for paid sick leave. Primary schools generally use a “generalist” system, where a single teacher teaches multiple subjects like English, math, humanities, science, art, and physical education, which may limit subject-specific expertise. Subject-specific teaching only begins in secondary school. The saying “the gym teacher taught my math” is not a joke in Spain but a result of the generalist system in primary schools. Exam scores are not ranked. 🈯 Language of Instruction and Multilingual Environment International schools primarily use English for instruction. Private and public schools mainly use Spanish. Autonomous communities like Valencia and Catalonia require students to learn the local regional language. In secondary school, a second foreign language such as French or German is added, making the multilingual workload demanding. 📖 Workload and Holiday Schedule There is less homework. The academic year is divided into three terms, with a total of about 160–180 teaching days. Holidays are long. 🇨🇳 Comparison with Basic Education in China Public Schools: School hours are from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM, with 6–8 classes per day. They are free, with some areas offering after-school care programs. Private/International Schools: 8:00 AM to 5:30 PM, with evening self-study sessions starting in middle school, which do not exist in Spain. Private: Approx. 60,000 RMB/year International: Approx. 180,000 RMB/year The academic year is divided into two semesters, with over 190 teaching days. 🏟️ Disparity in Campus Facilities International schools in China often boast campuses of over 100 acres, featuring heated swimming pools, theaters, multimedia libraries, maker labs, Olympic-standard stadiums, and even equestrian centers, golf courses, and drone and robotics labs. In contrast, Spanish schools are more modest and compact, with simpler facilities. 📘 Curriculum and Difficulty Many people believe that primary school math in China is much harder than abroad, but this is a long-standing misconception.

Many people assume that ancient China’s imperial examinations only tested the eight-legged essay, turning scholars into mere “bookworms.” But the opposite is true. For a very long time, the authentic imperial examination system required a dual focus on both humanities and sciences. Ancient China was not only a land of poetry, books, rites, and music but also a civilization that revered science and reason.

A few hours can easily cost tens of euros, which is a significant expense. To save money, consider using free roadside parking spots or the municipally provided blue line paid parking spaces.
Blue line parking spaces are cheaper, costing about â¬1 per hour. However, manual payment is cumbersome. You need to go to a nearby payment machine, enter your license plate number and parking duration, and pay with coins or a card. If you leave early, the refund process is also quite troublesome. Therefore, it’s highly recommended to use a convenient parking payment app for online payments and flexible billing, which is more economical.
