“Yangzi’s principle is ‘for oneself.’ He would not pluck a single hair from his body to benefit the world. Mozi advocates ‘universal love.’ If it would benefit the world, he would do it, even if it meant wearing himself out from head to heel. Zimo holds to the middle ground. Holding to the middle is closer to the right way, but to hold to the middle without weighing circumstances is the same as holding to one extreme. The reason for hating those who hold to one extreme is that they damage the Way, upholding one point while neglecting a hundred others.”

📚 School Hours and Tuition Differences Spanish Public Schools: School hours are from 9:00 AM to 2:00 PM, with 4 classes per day. Education is free. Spanish Private and International Schools: School hours are typically from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM, with 6 classes per day. The median tuition for private schools is approximately €6,000/year (about 50,000 RMB). International schools cost around €8,000/year (about 70,000 RMB). Costs vary significantly by grade level, region, and school, with differences of up to 1-2 times the median. 🏫 Teaching Staff and Pedagogical Features Teacher absenteeism is relatively high in Spain. A doctor’s note for sick leave is legally binding, and paid sick leave can be granted over the phone. Primary schools generally use a “generalist” system, where a single teacher teaches multiple subjects like English, math, humanities, science, art, and physical education, which may limit subject-specific expertise. Subject-specific teaching only begins in secondary school. The saying “the gym teacher taught my math” is not a joke in Spain but a result of the generalist system in primary schools. Exam scores are not ranked. 🈯 Language of Instruction and Multilingual Environment International schools primarily use English for instruction. Private and public schools mainly use Spanish. Autonomous communities like Valencia and Catalonia require students to learn the local regional language. In secondary school, a second foreign language such as French or German is added, making the multilingual workload demanding. 📖 Workload and Holiday Schedule There is less homework. The academic year is divided into three terms, with a total of about 160–180 instructional days. Holidays are long. 🇨🇳 Comparison with Basic Education in China Public Schools: School hours are from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM, with 6–8 classes per day. Education is free, with some regions offering after-school programs. Private/International Schools: 8:00 AM to 5:30 PM, with evening self-study sessions starting in middle school, which do not exist in Spain. Private: Approx. 60,000 RMB/year International: Approx. 180,000 RMB/year The academic year is divided into two semesters, with over 190 instructional days. 🏟️ Disparity in Campus Facilities International schools in China often have campuses exceeding 100 acres, featuring heated swimming pools, theaters, multimedia libraries, maker labs, Olympic-standard stadiums, and even equestrian centers, golf courses, and drone and robotics labs. In contrast, Spanish schools are modest and compact, with simpler facilities. 📘 Curriculum and Difficulty Many people believe that primary school math in China is much harder than abroad, but this is a long-standing misconception.

A few hours can easily cost tens of euros, which is a significant expense. To save money, consider using free roadside parking spots or the paid blue zone parking spaces provided by the municipality.
Blue zone parking spaces are cheaper, costing around â¬1 per hour. However, paying manually can be a hassle. You need to go to a nearby payment machine, enter your license plate number and parking duration, and pay with coins or a card. If you leave early, the refund process is also quite complicated. Therefore, it’s highly recommended to use a convenient parking payment app for online payments and flexible billing, which is more economical and practical.
