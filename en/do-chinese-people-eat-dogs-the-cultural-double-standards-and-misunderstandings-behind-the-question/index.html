Living abroad, especially at social gatherings, I&rsquo;m often asked this question: &lsquo;Do Chinese people eat dogs?&rsquo;
At that moment, the questioner&rsquo;s eyes are often filled with curiosity, or even judgment. I&rsquo;ve grown accustomed to offering a slight smile and listening to what they have to say.
Many overseas Chinese are surely familiar with this scenario. Westerners generally consider dogs to be &ldquo;man&rsquo;s best friend,&rdquo; not food. Therefore, whenever news about Chinese people eating dog meat surfaces, it always draws their intense scrutiny. The high status of dogs in their culture stems from nomadic traditions, where dogs were indispensable partners in hunting and herding. In contrast, the lifestyle of agricultural peoples was different; in agrarian cultures, dogs held no higher status than cattle."><meta name=author content><link rel=canonical href=/en/do-chinese-people-eat-dogs-the-cultural-double-standards-and-misunderstandings-behind-the-question/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.da3211e5ef867bf2b75fd5a6515cfed7195c011e8ab735694e203810a827097b.css integrity="sha256-2jIR5e+Ge/K3X9WmUVz+1xlcAR6KtzVpTiA4EKgnCXs=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=zh href=/zh/zhong-guo-ren-chi-gou-ma-bei-hou-de-wen-hua-shuang-biao-yu-wu-jie/><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=/en/do-chinese-people-eat-dogs-the-cultural-double-standards-and-misunderstandings-behind-the-question/><link rel=alternate hreflang=es href=/es/los-chinos-comen-perros-el-doble-rasero-cultural-y-los-malentendidos-detras-de-la-pregunta/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51);color-scheme:dark}.list{background:var(--theme)}.toc{background:var(--entry)}}@media(prefers-color-scheme:light){.list::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--code-bg)}}</style></noscript><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="dark":localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="light":window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches?document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="dark":document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="light"</script><script>(function(){var t,n,s,o="pref-theme",e=localStorage.getItem(o);if(e==="dark"||e==="light"){document.documentElement.classList.toggle("dark",e==="dark");return}t=(new Date).getHours(),n=t>=19||t<7,s=n,document.documentElement.classList.toggle("dark",s)})()</script><script>(function(){function e(e){localStorage.setItem("pref-theme",e),document.documentElement.classList.toggle("dark",e==="dark")}document.addEventListener("click",function(t){var n=t.target,s=n&&(n.id==="moon"?n:n.closest&&n.closest("#moon")),o=n&&(n.id==="sun"?n:n.closest&&n.closest("#sun"));s&&e("dark"),o&&e("light")})})()</script><style>.post-content img,.post-single img,article img{display:block;width:min(100%,800px);max-height:60vh;object-fit:contain;height:auto;margin:1rem auto;cursor:zoom-in}.hd-lightbox{position:fixed;inset:0;background:rgba(0,0,0,.85);display:none;align-items:center;justify-content:center;z-index:9999;padding:24px}.hd-lightbox.open{display:flex}.hd-lightbox img{max-width:min(96vw,1400px);max-height:92vh;width:auto;height:auto;cursor:zoom-out;border-radius:8px}.hd-lightbox .hint{position:fixed;top:12px;right:14px;font-size:12px;opacity:.75}</style><script>(function(){function e(e){document.readyState!=="loading"?e():document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",e)}e(function(){var t,e=document.createElement("div");e.className="hd-lightbox",e.innerHTML='<div class="hint">Click image / Press ESC to close</div><img alt=""/>',document.body.appendChild(e),t=e.querySelector("img");function n(){e.classList.remove("open"),t.src=""}e.addEventListener("click",n),document.addEventListener("keydown",function(e){e.key==="Escape"&&n()});function s(){var n=document.querySelectorAll(".post-content img, .post-single img, article img");n.forEach(function(n){if(n.dataset.hdBound)return;if(n.dataset.hdBound="1",n.naturalWidth&&n.naturalWidth<80||n.width&&n.width<80)return;n.addEventListener("click",function(s){s.preventDefault(),s.stopPropagation();var o=n.currentSrc||n.src;if(!o)return;t.src=o,e.classList.add("open")})})}s()})})()</script><meta property="og:url" content="/en/do-chinese-people-eat-dogs-the-cultural-double-standards-and-misunderstandings-behind-the-question/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="zixia"><meta property="og:title" content='"Do Chinese People Eat Dogs?": The Cultural Double Standards and Misunderstandings Behind the Question'><meta property="og:description" content="“Do Chinese People Eat Dogs?”: The Cultural Double Standards and Misunderstandings Behind the Question Living abroad, especially at social gatherings, I’m often asked this question: ‘Do Chinese people eat dogs?’ At that moment, the questioner’s eyes are often filled with curiosity, or even judgment.

I’ve grown accustomed to offering a slight smile and listening to what they have to say.\nMany overseas Chinese are surely familiar with this scenario. Westerners generally consider dogs to be “man’s best friend,” not food. Therefore, whenever news about Chinese people eating dog meat surfaces, it always draws their intense scrutiny. The high status of dogs in their culture stems from nomadic traditions, where dogs were indispensable partners in hunting and herding. In contrast, the lifestyle of agricultural peoples was different; in agrarian cultures, dogs held no higher status than cattle.\nWhen faced with this question, many might choose to deflect by emphasizing that “only a very small minority of Chinese people eat dog meat.” But from the perspective of cultural tradition and historical origins, my answer is this:\n“Dog meat is indeed one of the traditional foods of the Han Chinese. For example, Fan Kuai, a famous general of the Han Dynasty, started his career by selling dog meat. In the past, it was as normal for Chinese people to eat dog meat as it is for Westerners to eat beef. Meanwhile, in India, cows are considered sacred and inviolable. So, why is it that just because you like dogs, you think it’s wrong for others to eat them?”\nCultural Double Standards: Foie Gras, Milk, and Dog Meat In fact, the food cultures of Western countries are not entirely “humane” either. The French are fond of foie gras, which is produced by force-feeding geese to create fatty livers. This is considered a delicacy, but it is a form of torture for the geese. Westerners rely heavily on milk. To ensure a continuous supply, dairy cows are repeatedly impregnated, and their newborn calves are often sent directly to the slaughterhouse. Are these practices humane?\nHowever, these customs are taken for granted in their cultures. So, when Westerners question Chinese people for eating dog meat, shouldn’t they also reflect on whether their own dietary habits involve a “double standard”?\nI don’t eat dog meat myself, but I support the right of others to do so, as long as the source is legal and regulated. It is a matter of cultural and personal choice, and it shouldn’t be subject to generalization or moral grandstanding.\nThe Evolution of Cultural Aesthetics: From Demons to a Standard of Beauty The Chinese are no strangers to external aesthetic biases. In ancient Han Chinese perception, features like blonde hair, blue eyes, high-bridged noses, and deep-set eyes were once seen as symbols of “fierce demons.” If you look at traditional portraits of Zhong Kui or door gods, you’ll find that these figures, tasked with suppressing evil spirits, often possess features like high noses, deep-set eyes, large eyes, and thick eyebrows.\nHowever, under the influence of Western popular culture, these very features have now become the “standard of beauty.” This shift reflects the dominance of Western culture in global aesthetics.\nIn contrast, traditional Chinese aesthetic standards—the ethereal grace of the flying Apsaras in the Dunhuang murals, the gentle and plump figures in Tang Dynasty paintings of court ladies, and the subtle beauty of Lin Daiyu’s “phoenix eyes” in Dream of the Red Chamber—were the original essence of Han cultural aesthetics. Yet, under the impact of foreign cultures, these classic aesthetics have been gradually marginalized.\nRespect Differences, Reject Double Standards Cultural diversity is the foundation of our world’s richness. We may not agree with certain cultural customs, but we should approach them with respect and understanding, not judge them with double standards. Just as we have never criticized Western dietary habits, we hope that Chinese culture and traditions can be treated with the same tolerance.\nWhenever someone asks me, “Do Chinese people eat dogs?”, I don’t feel ashamed or angry. I know that this is not just a question about dog meat, but an opportunity for cultural exchange. Instead of viewing others with prejudice, it’s better to embrace diversity with an inclusive and open mind. After all, the beauty of the world lies in its richness and differences. Only through respect can we truly bridge the distance between us.\n","wordCount":"724","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2026-02-05T13:00:00Z","dateModified":"2026-02-05T13:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"/en/do-chinese-people-eat-dogs-the-cultural-double-standards-and-misunderstandings-behind-the-question/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"zixia","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=/en/ accesskey=h title="zixia (Alt + H)">zixia</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
