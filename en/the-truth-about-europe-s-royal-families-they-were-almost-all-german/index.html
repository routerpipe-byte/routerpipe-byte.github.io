The German warriors provided “force” and order. This was the underlying logic of what later became the “Holy Roman Empire.”\nIt wasn’t about cultural inheritance, but a power exchange.\nThen Things Started to Get Interesting Because the German lands were long in a state of:\nNo unified country Numerous princes and lords Every house was a military power Every house had a “legitimate bloodline” What did this mean?\nIt meant that this region became Europe’s—\nRoyal Reserve Pool.\nA dynasty in some country ended?\nGo find a replacement in Germany.\nA country’s situation is unstable?\nFind a German noble to stabilize things.\nOver time, almost all of Europe’s royal families were “contracted out” by this system.\nThe United Kingdom Is the Most Typical Example Many people think the British royal family is very “native,” but it’s quite the opposite.\nUntil before World War I, the official family name of the British royal family was: Saxe-Coburg-Gotha\nStandard German.\nBecause anti-German sentiment was so strong during WWI, they were forced to change it to the very “British-sounding” name we know today—Windsor.\nAnd you have to know something:\nThe mother tongue of early British kings was not English.\nThey were more accustomed to speaking German in their daily lives,\nEnglish was more the “language of their subjects.”\nHence the widely circulated phrase—\n“The King of England can’t speak English.”\nOther Countries Were the Same 🇪🇸 Spain The House of Bourbon came from France, and the French royal system itself was heavily influenced by the German nobility structure.\n🇧🇪 Belgium The royal family comes directly from a German noble family.\n🇳🇱 Netherlands The ruling family also belongs to the German nobility system.\n🇮🇹 Italy The royal family after unification came from a noble house in the Alpine region, which was itself a German-Italian hybrid system.\nNo matter how you look at it, it all comes back to the circle of German nobility.\nThis is not a coincidence, but a structural outcome.\nAnd Here’s the Real Irony Later, when Europe entered the era of nation-states,\npeople began to talk about “national identity” and “state identity.”\nBut before that—\nThe royal families who ruled these countries were precisely the group of people who cared the least about nationality.\nThey recognized only bloodlines, not borders;\nFor them, a country was just a “place of work.”\nEurope’s royal families were not symbols of their nations,\nThey were a small group of people who were the first to “go international” in the Middle Ages.\n","wordCount":"692","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","dateModified":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"/en/the-truth-about-europe-s-royal-families-they-were-almost-all-german/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"zixia","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=/en/ accesskey=h title="zixia (Alt + H)">zixia</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
