How to Study for the Theory Test

It is highly recommended not to just cram questions, because:

The question bank is vast. The English version has over 200 sets of tests, each with 30 questions, totaling more than 6,000 questions. Completing them all is time-consuming and exhausting.
The translations and questions in the bank may not be accurate, and the answers could be wrong.
The actual exam questions are not taken directly from the question bank, so finishing it is not a guarantee.
The knowledge in the question bank is fragmented and not systematic. Without systematic learning, you might not be able to answer if a question is phrased differently.

How to Study for the Theory Test It is highly recommended not to just cram questions, because:\nThe question bank is vast.

The actual exam questions are not taken directly from the question bank, so finishing it is not a guarantee. The knowledge in the question bank is fragmented and not systematic. Without systematic learning, you might not be able to answer if a question is phrased differently. Efficient Learning Method: Since I took the English exam, the following content is based on English materials.\nFirst, study the condensed content from the textbook: https://practicatest.com/en/book-theory-driving-test. The topics on this webpage are very concise and can be reviewed in about 4 hours. However, it does not cover new energy vehicles, environmental labels, electronic motorcycle helmets, or electric scooters, which you will need to study from the textbook materials. Complete Theory Manual: Most manuals are over 200 pages long, with a lot of content, requiring a long study time and can be tiring. It is recommended to supplement your learning by focusing on your weak areas while practicing questions. If you have time, you can skim through the entire manual. Digital versions of the English manual are circulated privately, but due to copyright issues, I can only provide a keyword for you to search on your own. You can also buy a physical copy on Amazon. Keyword: “Manual Permiso B inglés”. Online digital English manual: https://fliphtml5.com/lptj/szub/basic/51-100 Popular Question Banks Practicatest, AEOL, and Todotest are available options, all of which can be purchased online. Taking AEOL as an example: Purchase link: https://www.autoescueladummy.com/product-page/plan-premium Online question bank link: https://cloud.aeolservice.es/ It costs 10 euros per month. You need to enter your NIE number to link your account when purchasing. If you need to renew after it expires, you can purchase it again and enter the same NIE number to renew the account. AEOL Question Bank Usage Suggestions: Choose the 744 question bank and start practicing from the last few sets of tests. The question bank is not randomly arranged; the earlier sets contain old content, while the later ones have new exam topics. The latest exam topics (such as car environmental labels, electronic motorcycle helmets, new energy vehicles, electric scooters, etc.) may only appear in the last few new test sets. Older manuals may also not cover these topics, so supplementary study is required. Question Practice Tips: You don’t have to complete all the questions in the bank, as there are too many, and the actual exam questions are not identical to those in the bank. The actual exam consists of 30 questions to be completed in 30 minutes, with a maximum of 3 mistakes allowed. When your practice test accuracy reaches over 90%, the probability of passing the exam is very high. The AEOL question bank records your incorrect answers. Use the incorrect answer test feature to review and consolidate before the exam. DGT Free Mock Tests: The DGT official website provides 3 free English mock tests that you can use for practice: https://sedeapl.dgt.gob.es:7443/WEB_AUTO-6/examen/Instrucciones.jsf\n2. Self-Service Online Registration Booking an Appointment for the Theory Test Book an appointment on the official website: https://sede.dgt.gob.es/es/otros-tramites/cita-previa-jefaturas/index.shtml Click on “Solicitud de cita previa” and follow the prompts to book.

If you check for a few days, you will definitely get an appointment. Driving Test Medical Examination: List of medical centers: https://www.dgt.es/conoce-la-dgt/con-quien-trabajamos/centros-reconocimiento-conductores/ Just choose the one closest to you. Medical Examination Content: Inquiry about medical history; Concentration test (includes mini-games): A ball passes through an opaque box. You must judge the time it takes for the ball to pass through based on its speed and the distance to the sides of the box, then press a pause button. Control two small cars with your left and right hands respectively, driving them on two different tracks while avoiding hitting the edges. Vision test. Note: After the examination, check the information on your report (NIE number, name, date of birth, address, phone number, examination date, etc.). The medical report is valid for 3 months, so be sure to check the examination date. The fee is around 30 euros. You need to bring your NIE card. Test Fee Payment: Payment URL: https://sede.dgt.gob.es/es/otros-tramites/compra-y-actualizacion-de-tasas/ You can also access the payment form directly: https://sedeclave.dgt.gob.es/WEB_Tasas7/jsp/tasas/generarPresupuesto.jspx On the form, select “791-2.1”.
