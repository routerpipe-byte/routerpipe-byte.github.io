I had an in-depth discussion with an AI using data, and the conclusion might upend your assumptions.\n\n—\n\n## 01 Starting with the Intuition that "Stress = Mental Health Problems"\n\nInitially, the AI’s response was like most people’s:\n\n> "American education is more relaxed and thus more beneficial for adolescent mental health."\n\nThe reasoning was: less stress → less anxiety → better mental health.\n\nThis sounds logical, but it’s based on impressions and speculation, not data.\n\nSo I pressed further: "Can we compare this using quantitative metrics, like depression rates or suicide rates?"\n\n—\n\n## 02 Depression Rates: A Wide Discrepancy in Data\n\nThe AI found data on adolescent depression rates in China and the US, revealing a huge statistical variance for China:\n\n| Metric | China | United States |\n| — | — | — |\n| Diagnosed Depressive Disorder | ≈ 2% (6–16 years, national review, Child & Adolescent Psychiatry & Mental Health 2024) | ≈ 19–20% (12–17 years, major depressive episode in the past year, NIMH / SAMHSA NSDUH 2021–2022) |\n| Symptom Screening (Blue Book) | 14.8% (2022 edition), 24.6% (2020 edition) | – |\n| Meta-analysis Summary | ≈ 26% (synthesis of 439 studies) | – |\n| Large-sample CES-D Study | 39.93% positive | – |\n| PHQ-9 Positive (last 2 weeks) | – | 19.2% (CDC NHANES 2021–2023) |\n| Self-reported sadness/hopelessness in school | – | 42% (CDC YRBS 2021) |\n\nLooking only at this data, it’s easy to conclude that depression among Chinese adolescents is severe. However, depressive symptoms are heavily influenced by screening thresholds and cultural expression, so they can’t be the sole standard.\n\n—\n\n## 03 Suicide Rates: The Most Objective Mental Health Indicator\n\nTo eliminate cultural and measurement biases, I looked up adolescent suicide rates. The results were very clear:\n\n| Country | Age Group | Year | Suicide Rate (per 100,000) | Source |\n| — | — | — | — | — |\n| China | 10–19 years | 2021 | 2.83 | JAMA Pediatrics 2023 |\n| United States | 10–24 years | 2021 | 11.0 | CDC NCHS Data Brief 471 |\n\nThe adolescent suicide rate in the US is 3-4 times that of China. Even accounting for differences in statistical scope, the US rate is still significantly higher.\n\n \n\n—\n\n## 04 The AI Admits Its "Mistake"\n\nWhen I presented this data to the AI, it frankly admitted:\n\n> "My previous conclusion was based more on assumptions from my training data and general public opinion—that ‘high stress = poor mental health’—rather than reasoning from hard data."\n\nIt also stated that in the future, it would base its reasoning on objective data to avoid preconceived judgments and be truly scientific, objective, and fair.\n\nThis conversation left a deep impression on me: many parents, teachers, and even experts often rely on intuition rather than evidence when discussing "mental health." The facts and public opinion can be two different things.\n\n \n\n—\n\n## 05 The Rebound During the Pandemic\n\nIt’s worth noting that after hitting a low of 1.59 per 100,000 in 2017, China’s adolescent suicide rate rebounded to 2.83 per 100,000 in 2021.\n\nThis period coincided with the online learning phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many children were at home for online classes, lacking a classroom atmosphere, losing motivation to study, becoming addicted to online games and short videos, having their routines disrupted, and even experiencing increased conflict with family. Their mental state fluctuated.\n\nFrom this perspective, this rebound precisely illustrates that—\n\nFocused study and a regular lifestyle are important protective factors for adolescent mental health.\n\nWhen the rhythm of learning was disrupted and children were just "going through the motions" by playing games on their computers, their mental health actually worsened.\n\n—\n\n## 06 Stress Might Be Training for Psychological Resilience\n\nThe data tells us something unexpected:\n\n> Academic pressure does not necessarily lead to mental collapse; on the contrary, it may cultivate a child’s resilience.\n\nChinese children have to deal with exams, rankings, and comparisons from a young age, which teaches them emotional regulation and how to cope with setbacks earlier. In contrast, an overly relaxed environment may not help children deal with real-world pressures, potentially making them more fragile when they encounter genuine difficulties.\n\n—\n\n## 07 Takeaways for Parents\n\n* Don’t panic about pressure: Moderate academic stress can cultivate a sense of purpose and resilience.\n* Mental health isn’t just about "having fun": A regular routine, engagement in learning, and family support are more crucial.\n* Studying abroad is not a panacea: Adolescent suicide rates are higher in the West. Don’t see studying abroad as the only solution to mental health problems.\n\n—\n\n## 08 Conclusion\n\nJudging by the hard metric of suicide rates, the mental health of Chinese adolescents is no worse than that of their American counterparts, and may even be better.\n\nThe rebound during the pandemic also reminds us:\n\n> Maintaining a regular study routine and focus is an important safeguard for mental health, not indulging in online games.\n\nAnd the AI in this discussion also gave us a reminder:\n\n> Don’t blindly follow "public opinion and impressions." Instead, use objective data to reason and arrive at more truthful conclusions.” }

The full name is “Sistema de Información Poblacional”.\n\nWith this card, you can:\n\n* Visit public hospitals or local health centers;\n* Get various vaccines provided by the state (including flu, COVID-19, etc.);\n* Receive discounts on prescription medications;\n* Keep a record of your vaccinations and medical history.\n\n \n\n—\n\n### 🪪 1. What kind of SIP card can you get without social security?\n\nFor foreigners who are not working and do not contribute to social security (such as those with non-lucrative visas, students, accompanying parents, etc.), you can apply for a temporary SIP card “without healthcare coverage (sin cobertura sanitaria)”.\n\nThis type of SIP card will be marked with “PRIVAD”, which means you are temporarily not entitled to national health insurance reimbursement, but it can be used for vaccinations and emergency medical services.\n\n📍My card says:\n\n> Sin cobertura sanitaria – Pública gratuita vacunación y urgencias\n> (Without healthcare coverage, eligible for free vaccination and emergency services)\n\nThis type of SIP card is permanently valid; as long as your information doesn’t change, you don’t need to renew it annually.\n\n—\n\n### 📍 2. Where to apply?\n\nGo directly to the Centro de Salud (local health center) in your residential area.\n\nFor example, in my town:\n\n> Centre de Salut L’Eliana\n> Address: Av. del Parc, 3\n> Opening Hours: Monday to Friday 8:00–20:00\n> (SIP Application Hours: Monday to Friday 9:45–13:30)\n\nThe red sign at the entrance clearly states:👇\n\n> Conselleria de Sanitat Universal i Salut Pública\n> Generalitat Valenciana\n\n—\n\n \n\n### 🧾 3. Required Documents\n\nThe staff only asked for the following three items:\n\n1. ✅ Passport or NIE (residency card)\n2. ✅ Proof of address (empadronamiento, also known as padrón)\n3. ✅ Phone number, email address\n\nNo social security number or private health insurance is required.\n\nAs long as you are registered as a resident in the area, you can register and get a SIP number.\n\n—\n\n### 🪙 4. Application Process\n\n1️⃣ Go to the front desk of the health center and say:\n\n> “Hola, quiero solicitar una tarjeta SIP.”\n> (Hello, I’d like to apply for a SIP card.)\n\n2️⃣ The staff will verify your ID and address information.\n\n3️⃣ After a few minutes, they will print out a temporary paper SIP card on the spot (red text on a white background).\n\n4️⃣ If you have a residency card or long-term residence permit, you can apply for a formal plastic card.\n\nThe whole process was very fast; I got mine in about 10 minutes.\n\n \n\n—\n\n### 💉 5. Vaccination Process (Flu + COVID)\n\nIn the Valencian Community, a unified “Flu + COVID-19 Vaccination Campaign” starts every year in mid-October.\n\nThis year’s (2025) poster says:\n\n> 🗓 Dates: October 16 to November 30\n> 🕒 Monday, Thursday, Friday 10:00–13:00\n> 🕓 Specific dates in the afternoon 15:00–18:00\n> 📍 Location: Centre de Formación de Personas Adultas, L’Eliana (Av. del Parque, 3)\n\nThe key point is—\n\n> No requiere cita previa (No appointment needed)\n> Just bring your SIP card!\n\nThe atmosphere on-site is very relaxed. Volunteers and nurses will help you with registration and vaccination.\n\nOne flu shot, one COVID shot, and you’re done in a few minutes.\n\nSeniors, patients with chronic illnesses, children, and foreign residents can all get vaccinated for free.\n\n—\n\n### 🧍‍♀️ 6. On-site Experience\n\nThe vaccination site was set up at the municipal adult education center. The queue wasn’t long, about a 20-minute wait, mostly with elderly people.\n\nThe nurses were very skilled.\n\n \n\n💬 A nurse on-site specifically emphasized:\n\n> “As long as you have a SIP card, you can get vaccinated, regardless of whether you contribute to social security.”\n\n—\n\n### 💬 7. Frequently Asked Questions (Q&amp;A)\n\nQ1: My SIP card says “PRIVAD”. Can I get vaccinated?\n✅ Yes! This type of card specifically allows for free vaccinations.\n\nQ2: Does the temporary SIP card have an expiration date?\n⏳ There is no fixed expiration date. It remains valid as long as your information doesn’t change.\n\nQ3: Can I apply without a padrón (address registration)?\n❌ No. The padrón is the only official proof that you live in the area, so it’s mandatory. If you have a personal digital certificate, you can apply for and print it for free directly from the city hall’s website of your registered municipality, saving you a trip. For minors, parents can use their digital certificate to apply on their behalf under the collective residence certificate section on the city hall’s website. Approval takes about 1-3 business days, after which you can download the PDF certificate, all for free.\n\nQ4: Can I bring my child to get vaccinated?\n👧 Yes, children can also get their own SIP card. You just need to bring their NIE and padrón certificate; the child does not need to be present.\n\n—\n\n### ❤️ 8. Conclusion\n\nIn Spain, even if you don’t have a job or contribute to social security, as long as you are a resident, you can access basic public health services.\n\nSo don’t hesitate—grab your passport and proof of address, and head to your nearest health center to get a SIP card!\n\nNot only will you be able to get vaccinated, but it also creates a convenient record for future medical care.\n\n—\n\n📌 Summary of Practical Information:\n\n| Item | Information |\n| — | — |\n| Application Location | Centre de Salut (Local Health Center) |\n| Required Documents | Passport/NIE + Padrón (proof of address) |\n| Social Security Required? | ❌ No |\n| Appointment Required? | ❌ No |\n| Available Vaccines | Flu / COVID-19 / Childhood vaccines, etc. |\n| Cost | Free |\n| Eligible Population | All residents in Spain (including foreigners) |\n\n—” }

A few hours can easily cost tens of euros, which is a significant expense. To save money, you can opt for free roadside parking spots or the municipally provided blue zone paid parking spaces.\n\nBlue zone parking is cheaper, around €1 per hour, but manual payment is cumbersome.

Therefore, it’s crucial to master the following common commands and their Spanish expressions:\n\n* Start the engine: Arrancar\n* Turn right: Derecha\n* Turn left: Izquierda\n* Go straight: Recto\n* Make a U-turn: Cambio de sentido\n* Indirect left turn: izquierda indirecto\n* Roundabout: Rotonda\n* First exit: Primera salida\n* Second exit: Segunda salida\n* Third exit: Tercera salida\n* Fourth exit: Cuarta salida\n* Stop: Parar\n* Park: Aparcar\n\nIf you don’t hear an instruction clearly, you can ask the examiner to repeat it in Spanish, for example: “Por favor repita”.\n\n### Be Aware of Deviations in Examiner Instructions\n\nSometimes the examiner might give an incorrect instruction, either intentionally or unintentionally. For example, if they tell you to turn right but there’s a sign prohibiting it, you should ignore the instruction and follow the road signs.\n\nAlso, maintain a wide field of vision while driving. Be aware that road markings are often about 30 meters before an intersection, and there might not be a corresponding sign at the intersection itself. Pay attention to vertical signs and traffic lights, with traffic lights having the highest priority. If there’s a STOP sign at an intersection but the traffic light is green, you must follow the higher-priority traffic light and not stop.\n\n### Understanding Roundabout Rules\n\n* Urban Roundabouts:\n * For left turns and U-turns, you must use the inner lane.\n * When the inner lane has a traffic light, you can proceed directly on green. A flashing yellow light means you must yield to traffic from the right. Be sure to look to your right; you must yield to cars that are 25 meters away because they are moving fast.\n * For right turns and going straight, you should use the outer lane.\n\n* Interurban (Out-of-town) Roundabouts:\n * Always use the outer lane, unless you are overtaking, in which case you can use the inner lane.\n\nWhen exiting a roundabout, be sure to signal right in advance and use your turn signals correctly to help with lane changes. If traffic prevents you from changing from an inner lane to exit, continue circling the roundabout until it’s safe to change lanes. Then, switch to the rightmost lane (the further right, the better) to exit (in Spain, consecutive lane changes are allowed). For complex roundabouts split into several islands, to make a left turn, you might enter from the rightmost lane, while going straight might require the middle or leftmost lane. The keyword for this is indirecto.\n\n### Lane Choice and Intersection Driving\n\n* When Going Straight:\n * If there are three lanes, you should generally choose the first lane from the right (the rightmost lane).\n * If there are more than three lanes, it’s recommended to use the second lane from the right.\n\n* When Passing Through Intersections:\n * Avoid stopping on pedestrian crossings, bike lanes, or other special lanes, especially in congested areas marked with a cross-hatched grid (yellow box).\n * If the vehicle ahead stops due to lack of space, you should stop early and wait, ensuring your vehicle does not block these special lanes.\n\n### Safe Driving and Right-of-Way Awareness\n\nSpanish traffic laws are very strict about the right of way. People have a strong sense of it. On pedestrian crossings without traffic lights, pedestrians have absolute priority. They are not in the habit of looking both ways for traffic and may cross suddenly. Therefore, when driving in areas where you do not have the right of way, you must be highly alert, especially on sections with yield signs. You need to check for oncoming traffic in bike lanes or vehicle lanes behind you, and physically turn your head to confirm the situation.\n\nHowever, when you have a green light, you must not slow down or stop for pedestrians on a crosswalk, unless there is an unavoidable emergency, in which case only emergency braking is permitted. When approaching a crosswalk without a traffic light, you should slow down appropriately. If there are signs indicating students or children, you must perform a braking action to reduce speed.\n\nGenerally, the speed limit on urban roads is 50 km/h, while single-lane roads may be limited to 30 or 20 km/h. Outside the city, the limit is typically 90 km/h, and 120 km/h on highways. You are generally expected to drive as close to the speed limit as possible; going 2-5 km/h over the limit is usually acceptable.\n\n### STOP Signs and Temporary Stopping Requirements\n\nWhen you encounter a STOP line on the road, you must stop before the line for 3 seconds. Then, after moving forward about 1-2 meters past the line, you must stop again to check for traffic. This double stop is a test requirement. If visibility is poor, you should stop multiple times to ensure it’s safe.\n\nHowever, note that if there is also a traffic light, you must strictly follow the light’s signal. You are not allowed to stop at a green light; you must proceed directly. Stopping in this situation will result in points being deducted. If there is no stop line, you should position your car about one meter into the intersection, stop for at least 3 seconds, confirm it’s safe, and then proceed.\n\n### Road Test Procedure and Driving Strategy\n\nThe road test usually begins with 3-5 minutes of free driving, after which the examiner will give specific instructions. Since you may not be familiar with many of the routes, it’s advisable to look for road signs far in advance. For example, you might need to enter a roundabout from the left lane, while the right lane is for other directions; signs above the intersection usually indicate this. Sometimes, a left turn doesn’t necessarily mean using the left lane; you might need to make the turn from the right lane. In all such cases, you must observe the road markings or overhead signs ahead of time and prepare to change lanes. If it’s too late to change lanes safely, it’s better to disobey the examiner’s instruction than to make a forced lane change.\n\nIf road markings are hard to see because they are blocked by a large vehicle or are faded, and there are no clear directional or prohibitive signs at the intersection, you can watch for hand signals from your instructor. When in doubt, it’s advisable to turn right and avoid turning left if possible.\n\n \n\n> The road sign above indicates entering the roundabout from the left lane.\n\n \n\n> Prioritize the traffic light on the right; do not stop for the STOP sign when the light is green.\n\n \n\n> The road markings indicate a right turn only, but there is no sign at the intersection prohibiting a left turn.

📚 School Hours and Tuition Differences Spanish Public Schools: School hours are from 9:00 AM to 2:00 PM, with 4 classes per day. It’s free. Spanish Private and International Schools: School hours are typically from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM, with 6 classes per day. The median tuition for private schools is about €6,000/year (approx. 50,000 RMB). International schools are about €8,000/year (approx. 70,000 RMB). There are significant variations based on grade level, region, and school, with differences of 1-2 times the median. 🏫 Teaching Staff and Pedagogical Features Teacher absenteeism is relatively high in Spain. A doctor’s note for sick leave is legally binding and can be issued over the phone for paid sick leave. Primary school generally follows a “generalist” system, where one teacher teaches multiple subjects like English, math, humanities, science, art, and physical education, limiting subject-specific expertise. Subject-specific teaching only begins in middle school. The saying “the gym teacher teaches math” is not a joke in Spain but a result of the primary school generalist system. Exam scores are not ranked. 🈯 Language of Instruction and Multilingual Environment International schools primarily use English for instruction. Private and public schools mainly use Spanish. Autonomous communities like Valencia and Catalonia require the study of local languages. A second foreign language, such as French or German, is introduced in middle school, making the multilingual workload heavy. 📖 Workload and Holiday Schedule Less homework after school. The academic year is divided into three terms, with a total of about 160–180 teaching days. Long holidays. 🇨🇳 Comparison with Basic Education in China Public Schools: School hours are from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM, with 6–8 classes per day. It’s free, with some regions offering after-school programs. Private/International Schools: 8:00 AM to 5:30 PM, with evening self-study sessions starting in middle school, which do not exist in Spain. Private: Approx. 60,000 RMB/year International: Approx. 180,000 RMB/year The academic year is divided into two semesters, with over 190 teaching days. 🏟️ Campus Facility Gap International schools in China often boast campuses of over 100 acres, featuring heated swimming pools, theaters, multimedia libraries, maker labs, Olympic-standard stadiums, and even equestrian fields, golf courses, and drone and robotics labs. Spanish schools, in contrast, are modest and compact, with simple facilities. 📘 Curriculum and Difficulty Many people believe that Chinese primary school math is much harder than in other countries, but this is a long-standing misconception.

Many people assume that ancient China’s imperial examinations only tested the eight-legged essay, turning scholars into mere “bookworms.” But the opposite is true. For a very long time, the authentic imperial examination system required a dual focus on both humanities and sciences. Ancient China was not only a land of poetry, books, rites, and music but also a civilization that revered science and reason.
