📚 School Hours and Tuition Differences Spanish Public Schools: School hours are from 9:00 AM to 2:00 PM, with 4 classes per day. It’s free. Spanish Private and International Schools: School hours are typically from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM, with 6 classes per day. The median tuition for private schools is about €6,000/year (approx. 50,000 RMB). International schools are about €8,000/year (approx. 70,000 RMB). There are significant variations based on grade level, region, and school, with differences of 1-2 times the median. 🏫 Teaching Staff and Pedagogical Features Teacher absenteeism is relatively high in Spain. A doctor’s note for sick leave is legally binding and can be issued over the phone for paid sick leave. Primary school generally follows a “generalist” system, where one teacher teaches multiple subjects like English, math, humanities, science, art, and physical education, limiting subject-specific expertise. Subject-specific teaching only begins in middle school. The saying “the gym teacher teaches math” is not a joke in Spain but a result of the primary school generalist system. Exam scores are not ranked. 🈯 Language of Instruction and Multilingual Environment International schools primarily use English for instruction. Private and public schools mainly use Spanish. Autonomous communities like Valencia and Catalonia require the study of local languages. A second foreign language, such as French or German, is introduced in middle school, making the multilingual workload heavy. 📖 Workload and Holiday Schedule Less homework after school. The academic year is divided into three terms, with a total of about 160–180 teaching days. Long holidays. 🇨🇳 Comparison with Basic Education in China Public Schools: School hours are from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM, with 6–8 classes per day. It’s free, with some regions offering after-school programs. Private/International Schools: 8:00 AM to 5:30 PM, with evening self-study sessions starting in middle school, which do not exist in Spain. Private: Approx. 60,000 RMB/year International: Approx. 180,000 RMB/year The academic year is divided into two semesters, with over 190 teaching days. 🏟️ Campus Facility Gap International schools in China often boast campuses of over 100 acres, featuring heated swimming pools, theaters, multimedia libraries, maker labs, Olympic-standard stadiums, and even equestrian fields, golf courses, and drone and robotics labs. Spanish schools, in contrast, are modest and compact, with simple facilities. 📘 Curriculum and Difficulty Many people believe that Chinese primary school math is much harder than in other countries, but this is a long-standing misconception.

Many people assume that ancient China’s imperial examinations only tested the eight-legged essay, turning scholars into mere “bookworms.” But the opposite is true. For a very long time, the authentic imperial examination system required a dual focus on both humanities and sciences. Ancient China was not only a land of poetry, books, rites, and music but also a civilization that revered science and reason.

A few hours can easily cost tens of euros, which is a significant expense. To save money, consider using free roadside parking spots or the municipally provided blue line paid parking spaces.
Blue line parking spaces are cheaper, costing about â¬1 per hour. However, manual payment is cumbersome. You need to go to a nearby payment machine, enter your license plate number and parking duration, and pay with coins or a card. If you leave early, the refund process is also quite troublesome. Therefore, it’s highly recommended to use a convenient parking payment app for online payments and flexible billing, which is more economical.
