However, when we conduct a side-by-side comparison with China, particularly its capital Beijing, we find that Spain has significant shortcomings in many core aspects of life. Based on the latest data from 2024, this article provides a systematic comparison between Madrid and Beijing across various dimensions, including consumer costs, education, healthcare, transportation, housing, home appliances, automobiles, and public safety, to deeply reveal the various inconveniences and cost pressures of living in Spain. 1.

The imperial examination system was not just about the eight-legged essay; it originally combined both arts and sciences.
The foundation of Han civilization’s belief system is rationality and ethics, not theocracy.
While Europe was burning in the flames of faith, China had long revered science.
Many people think ancient imperial exams only tested the eight-legged essay, and scholars were all “bookworms.” But the opposite is true. For a long time, the true imperial examination system was a “dual cultivation of arts and sciences.” Ancient China was not only a nation of poetry, literature, rites, and music but also a civilization that revered science and rationality. 📖 I. The Origin of the Imperial Examinations: Giving Every Humble Scholar a Chance Emperor Yang of Sui initiated the imperial examination system, and the Tang Dynasty perfected it. This system broke the monopoly of aristocratic clans, allowing commoners to enter officialdom based on knowledge. It was the world’s earliest “meritocratic system for talent.”

Europe did not suddenly learn republicanism; it had long lived with the political experience that “a republic could exist.”
In Europe, the republic was never a momentary flash of inspiration, but a continuous institutional tradition spanning over two thousand years. Public affairs do not necessarily belong to the king This tradition can be traced back to ancient Greece.

A Personal Account", "body": "I recently went through the process myself at the community health center (Centre de Salut L’Eliana) in **L’Eliana**, in the Valencia region of Spain, and discovered that **even foreigners who do not pay into social security can get a free SIP card and receive the flu and COVID-19 mRNA vaccines!**\n\nToday, I'm sharing the entire process in detail to help others who might need it.\n\n---\n\n### 💡 What is a SIP card?\n\nThe SIP is the personal identification card for the Spanish healthcare system. Its full name is **“Sistema de Información Poblacional”**.\n\nWith this card, you can:\n\n* Visit public hospitals or community health centers;\n* Receive various vaccines provided by the state (including flu, COVID-19, etc.);\n* Get discounts on prescription medications;\n* Keep a record of your vaccinations and medical history.\n\n ![](/images/wechat/925f956c0bae.jpg) \n\n---\n\n### 🪪 1. What kind of SIP card can you get without social security contributions?\n\nFor foreigners who are not working and do not contribute to social security (such as those with non-lucrative visas, students, or accompanying parents), you can apply for a temporary SIP card **\"without healthcare coverage (sin cobertura sanitaria)\"**.\n\nThis type of SIP card will be marked with \"**PRIVAD**,\" which means you are temporarily not entitled to national health insurance reimbursement, but it **can be used for vaccinations and emergency medical services**.\n\n📍My card is printed with:\n\n> *Sin cobertura sanitaria – Pública gratuita vacunación y urgencias*\n> (Without healthcare coverage, free vaccination and emergency services)\n\nThis type of SIP card is **permanently valid**; as long as your information doesn't change, you don't need to renew it annually.\n\n---\n\n### 📍 2. Where to apply?\n\nGo directly to the **Centro de Salud (community health center)** that corresponds to your residential area.\n\nFor example, in my town:\n\n> **Centre de Salut L’Eliana**\n> Address: Av. del Parc, 3\n> Office Hours: Monday to Friday 8:00–20:00\n> (SIP Application Hours: Monday to Friday 9:45–13:30)\n\nThe red sign at the entrance clearly states👇\n\n> *Conselleria de Sanitat Universal i Salut Pública*\n> *Generalitat Valenciana*\n\n---\n\n ![](/images/wechat/f921d4260064.png) \n\n### 🧾 3. Required Documents\n\nThe staff only asked for the following three items:\n\n1. ✅ Passport or NIE (residence card)\n2. ✅ Proof of address (empadronamiento, also known as padron)\n3. ✅ Phone number, email address\n\nNo social security contributions or private health insurance are required.\n\nAs long as you are a resident in the area, you can register and receive a SIP number.\n\n---\n\n### 🪙 4. Application Process\n\n1️⃣ Go to the health center's front desk and say:\n\n> “Hola, quiero solicitar una tarjeta SIP.”\n> (Hello, I would like to apply for a SIP card.)\n\n2️⃣ The staff will verify your ID and address information.\n\n3️⃣ After a few minutes, they will print out a temporary, paper SIP card on the spot (white with red text).\n\n4️⃣ If you have a residence card or long-term residency proof, you can apply for a formal plastic card.\n\nThe whole process was very fast; I got mine in about 10 minutes.\n\n ![](/images/wechat/5e2b7583d416.png) \n\n---\n\n### 💉 5. Vaccination Process (Flu + COVID-19)\n\nThe Valencia region holds a unified **\"Flu + COVID-19 Vaccination Campaign\"** starting in mid-October each year.\n\nThis year's (2025) poster says:\n\n> 🗓 **Dates: October 16 to November 30**\n> 🕒 Monday, Thursday, Friday 10:00–13:00\n> 🕓 Specific dates in the afternoon 15:00–18:00\n> 📍 Location: Centre de Formación de Personas Adultas, L’Eliana (Av. del Parque, 3)\n\nThe key point is—\n\n> **No requiere cita previa (No appointment required)**\n> Just bring your **SIP card**!\n\nThe atmosphere on-site is very relaxed, and volunteers and nurses will help you register and get vaccinated.\n\nOne shot for the flu, one for COVID-19, all done in a few minutes.\n\nThe elderly, patients with chronic diseases, children, and foreign residents can all get vaccinated for free.\n\n---\n\n### 🧍‍♀️ 6. On-site Experience\n\nThe vaccination site was set up at the Municipal Adult Education Center. The line wasn't long, about a 20-minute wait, mostly with elderly people.\n\nThe nurses were very skilled.\n\n ![](/images/wechat/76a33f55aea8.png) \n\n💬 A nurse on-site specifically emphasized:\n\n> “As long as you have a SIP card, you can get vaccinated, regardless of whether you contribute to social security.”\n\n---\n\n### 💬 7. Frequently Asked Questions (Q&amp;A)\n\n**Q1: My SIP card says “PRIVAD.” Can I get vaccinated?**\n✅ Yes! This type of card specifically allows for free vaccinations.\n\n**Q2: Does the temporary SIP card have an expiration date?**\n⏳ There is no fixed expiration date. It remains valid as long as your information does not change.\n\n**Q3: Can I apply without a padron (proof of address)?**\n❌ No. The padron is the only document that proves you live in the area, so it is mandatory. If you have a personal digital certificate, you can apply for and print it for free directly from the city hall's website where you are registered, saving you a trip. For minors, parents can use their digital certificate to apply on their behalf under the collective residence certificate section on the city hall's website. Approval takes about 1-3 business days, after which you can download the PDF certificate, all for free.\n\n**Q4: Can I bring my child to get vaccinated?**\n👧 Yes, children can also get their own SIP card. You just need to bring their NIE and padron (proof of address); the child does not need to be present.\n\n---\n\n### ❤️ 8. Summary\n\nIn Spain, even if you don't have a job and don't pay into social security, as long as you are a resident, you can access **basic public health services**.\n\nSo don't hesitate—grab your passport and proof of address, and head to your nearest health center to get a SIP card!\n\nNot only can you get vaccinated, but it also creates a convenient record for future medical care.\n\n---\n\n📌 **Practical Information Summary:**\n\n| Item | Information |\n| --- | --- |\n| Application Location | Centre de Salut (community health center) |\n| Required Documents | Passport/NIE + padron (proof of address) |\n| Social Security Required | ❌ No |\n| Appointment Required | ❌ No |\n| Available Vaccines | Flu / COVID-19 / Childhood vaccines, etc. |\n| Cost | Free |\n| Eligible Population | All residents in Spain (including foreigners) |\n\n---" }</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2026-02-04 11:20:36 +0000 UTC'>February 4, 2026</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<span>5 min</span></footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to 在西班牙没交社保，也能办SIP卡（社保卡）、打疫苗！亲身实录分享" href=/en/sip/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>西班牙街道蓝线停车必备APP及机场长时停车省钱攻略</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>{ "title": "Essential Apps for Blue-Line Street Parking in Spain & a Money-Saving Guide for Long-Term Airport Parking", "body": "In Spain, commercial parking lots are generally expensive. A few hours can easily cost tens of euros, which is a significant expense. To save money, consider using free roadside parking spots or the blue-line paid parking spaces provided by the municipality.\n\nBlue-line parking spaces are cheaper, costing around €1 per hour, but manual payment is quite cumbersome. You need to go to a nearby payment machine, enter your license plate number and parking duration, and pay with coins or a card. If you leave early, the refund process is also quite troublesome. Therefore, it's highly recommended to use convenient parking payment apps for online payment and flexible billing, which is more economical and practical.\n\nAdditionally, taxi fares to Spanish airports are high. Traveling from a smaller city to Madrid's airport by train or bus can be troublesome and time-consuming. It would be much more convenient to park your own car near the airport and drive home directly upon your return. However, official airport parking is expensive, and long-term parking fees can be a major expense. So, how can you save money? In fact, there are specialized long-term parking lots near Spanish airports, with costs around €4 per day. This option is the most cost-effective for those traveling in groups.\n\n## I.

If you need to stay longer than 2 hours, you can end the current parking session in the app and immediately start a new one.\n\n ![](/images/wechat/25e1c194ea9b.jpg) \n\n ![](/images/wechat/f6c8463d69cf.jpg) \n\n### EasyPark: A Must-Have for European Road Trips\n\nEasyPark is ideal for users who frequently travel across European countries.

Therefore, it is crucial to master the following common commands and their Spanish expressions:\n\n* **Start the engine**: Arrancar\n* **Turn right**: Derecha\n* **Turn left**: Izquierda\n* **Go straight**: Recto\n* **Make a U-turn**: Cambio de sentido\n* **Indirect left turn**: izquierda indirecto\n* **Roundabout**: Rotonda\n* **First exit**: Primera salida\n* **Second exit**: Segunda salida\n* **Third exit**: Tercera salida\n* **Fourth exit**: Cuarta salida\n* **Stop**: Parar\n* **Park**: Aparcar\n\nIf you don't hear an instruction clearly, you can ask the examiner to repeat it in Spanish, for example: “Por favor repita”.\n\n### **Pay Attention to Deviations in Examiner Instructions**\n\nSometimes the examiner might give an incorrect instruction, either intentionally or unintentionally. For example, if instructed to turn right, but there is a traffic sign at the intersection or on the road prohibiting a right turn, you should ignore the instruction and continue to follow the road signs.\n\nAt the same time, you should maintain a wide field of vision while driving and be aware that road markings are often about 30 meters before an intersection, while there may be no corresponding signs at the intersection itself. There are also vertical signs and traffic lights, with traffic lights having the highest priority. If there is a vertical STOP sign at an intersection but also a green light, you must strictly follow the higher-priority traffic light and not stop.\n\n### **Understanding Roundabout Rules**\n\n* **Urban roundabouts:**\n * For left turns and U-turns, you must use the inner lane.\n * When the inner lane has traffic lights, you can proceed directly on a green light. A flashing yellow light means you must yield to traffic from the right. Be sure to look to your right; you should yield to cars that are 25 meters away because they are moving fast.\n * For right turns and going straight, you should choose the outer lane.\n\n* **Roundabouts outside the city:**\n * Always use the outer lane, unless you are overtaking, in which case you can use the inner lane.\n\nWhen exiting a roundabout, be sure to signal right in advance and use your turn signal correctly to assist with lane changes. If traffic congestion prevents you from changing lanes to exit from the inner lane, you should continue to circle the roundabout until it is safe to change lanes, then switch to the rightmost lane (the further right, the better) to exit (in Spain, changing multiple lanes consecutively is permitted). For complex roundabouts divided into several islands, when making a circuitous left turn, enter from the rightmost lane. For going straight, you should choose the middle or leftmost lane. The keyword is *indirecto*.\n\n### **Lane Selection and Intersection Driving**\n\n* **When going straight:**\n * If there are three lanes, you should generally choose the first lane from the right;\n * If there are more than three lanes, it is recommended to use the second lane.\n\n* **When passing through intersections:**\n * Avoid stopping on pedestrian crossings, bike lanes, or other special lanes, especially in congested areas marked with a yellow cross-hatch.\n * If the vehicle ahead stops due to lack of space, you should stop early and wait, ensuring your stopping position does not obstruct these special lanes.\n\n### **Safe Driving and Right-of-Way Awareness**\n\nSpanish traffic laws are very strict about right-of-way. People have a strong sense of right-of-way. At crosswalks without traffic lights, pedestrians have absolute priority. They are not in the habit of looking left and right for traffic and may cross suddenly. Therefore, when driving in areas where you do not have the right-of-way, you must remain highly alert, especially in sections with yield signs. You need to check for approaching traffic in bike lanes or vehicle lanes behind you and turn your head to confirm the situation.\n\nHowever, when you have a green light, even if there are pedestrians on the crosswalk, you must not slow down or stop in advance, unless there is an unavoidable emergency, in which case only emergency braking is permitted. When approaching a crosswalk without traffic lights, you should slow down appropriately. If there are signs indicating students or children, you also need to perform a braking action to reduce speed.\n\nGenerally, the speed limit on urban roads is 50 km/h, while single-lane roads may be limited to 30 or 20 km/h. Roads outside the city are typically 90 km/h, and highways are 120 km/h. You are generally expected to drive as close to the maximum speed limit as possible; even exceeding it by 2-5 km/h is acceptable.\n\n### **STOP Signs and Temporary Stopping Requirements**\n\nWhen you encounter a STOP line on the road, you must stop before the line and wait for 3 seconds. Then, after moving about 1-2 meters past the line, you must stop again to observe the traffic conditions. This double stop is a test requirement. If visibility is poor, you should stop multiple times to ensure it is safe.\n\nHowever, note that if there is also a traffic light, you must strictly follow the light's signal. You are not allowed to stop on a green light and must proceed directly; stopping in this case will result in a penalty. If there is no stop line, you should position your car about one meter into the intersection, stop for at least 3 seconds, confirm it is safe, and then proceed.\n\n### **Driving Test Procedure and Strategy**\n\nThe driving test usually begins with 3-5 minutes of independent driving, after which the examiner will give instructions based on the situation. Since you may not be familiar with many of the routes on your first drive, it is advisable to observe distant road signs in advance. For example, entering a roundabout might require you to be in the left lane, while the right lane is for other directions; there are usually traffic signs above the intersection to indicate this. Sometimes, a left turn is not necessarily made from the left lane but may need to be completed from the right lane. In such cases, you must observe the road markings or overhead signs ahead of time and prepare to change lanes. If it's too late to change lanes, it is better to disobey the examiner's instruction than to force a lane change.\n\nIf road markings are difficult to see because they are blocked by a large vehicle or are faded, and there are no clear directional or prohibitive signs at the intersection, you can watch for hand signals from your instructor. When in doubt, it is advisable to choose to turn right and try to avoid turning left.\n\n ![](/images/wechat/b8469f50e5d2.jpg) \n\n> The overhead road sign indicates entering the roundabout from the left lane.\n\n ![](/images/wechat/e13d835e1a4d.jpg) \n\n> Prioritize the traffic light on the right; do not stop at a green light.\n\n ![](/images/wechat/35d3cf03f638.jpg) \n\n> The road markings indicate a right turn only, but there is no sign at the intersection prohibiting a left turn. Therefore, if a large vehicle is blocking the view, it's difficult to recognize that a left turn is not allowed.\n\n ![](/images/wechat/d58308650bda.jpg) \n\n ![](/images/wechat/0148c0d9afcf.jpg) \n\n> Two ways to navigate a roundabout" }</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2026-02-04 11:20:36 +0000 UTC'>February 4, 2026</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<span>6 min</span></footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to 西班牙驾照路考经验" href=/en/post/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>送孩子去欧美留学真的更利于心理健康吗？</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>{ "title": "Is Sending Your Child to Study in Europe or the US Really Better for Their Mental Health?", "body": "Many parents send their children to study in Europe or the US for a common reason:\n\n> \"Education abroad is more relaxed, kids have less pressure, are less prone to depression, and it's better for their mental health.\"\n\nIt sounds reasonable: children in China have a lot of homework, intense competition, and frequent exams, while children abroad seem happier, getting out of school around 3 p.m. for sports, clubs, dances, and summer camps.\n\nBut is this really the case? I had an in-depth discussion with an AI using data, and the conclusion might upend your assumptions.\n\n---\n\n## 01 Starting with the Intuition that 'Stress = Mental Health Problems'\n\nInitially, the AI's response was like most people's:\n\n> \"The American education system is more relaxed and thus more beneficial for adolescent mental health.\"\n\nIts reasoning was: Less stress → Less anxiety → Better mental health.\n\nThis sounds logical, but it's based on impressions and speculation, not supported by data.\n\nSo I pressed further: \"Can we compare using quantitative indicators, like depression rates or suicide rates?\"\n\n---\n\n## 02 Depression Rates: Significant Data Discrepancies\n\nThe AI found adolescent depression rates for both China and the US, revealing huge statistical discrepancies for China:\n\n| Metric | China | USA |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Diagnosed Depressive Disorder** | ≈ **2%** (ages 6–16, national review, Child & Adolescent Psychiatry & Mental Health 2024) | ≈ **19–20%** (ages 12–17, major depressive episode in the past year, NIMH / SAMHSA NSDUH 2021–2022) |\n| **Symptom Screening (Blue Book)** | 14.8% (2022 edition), 24.6% (2020 edition) | – |\n| **Meta-analysis Summary** | ≈ 26% (synthesis of 439 studies) | – |\n| **Large-sample CES-D Study** | 39.93% positive | – |\n| **PHQ-9 Positive in Past Two Weeks** | – | 19.2% (CDC NHANES 2021–2023) |\n| **Self-reported Sadness/Hopelessness on Campus** | – | 42% (CDC YRBS 2021) |\n\nLooking only at this data, it's easy to conclude that \"depression among Chinese adolescents is severe.\" However, depressive symptoms are heavily influenced by scale thresholds and cultural expression, so they cannot be the sole standard.\n\n---\n\n## 03 Suicide Rates: The Most Objective Indicator of Mental Health\n\nTo eliminate cultural and scale-related biases, I looked up adolescent suicide rates. The results were very clear:\n\n| Country | Age Group | Year | Suicide Rate (per 100,000) | Source |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| China | 10–19 | 2021 | **2.83** | JAMA Pediatrics 2023 |\n| USA | 10–24 | 2021 | **11.0** | CDC NCHS Data Brief 471 |\n\nThe suicide rate among American adolescents is 3-4 times that of China's. Even accounting for differences in statistical scope, the US rate is still significantly higher.\n\n ![](/images/wechat/95e9a1fd9820.png) \n\n---\n\n## 04 The AI Admitted Its 'Mistake'\n\nWhen I presented this data to the AI, it frankly admitted:\n\n> \"My previous conclusion was based more on assumptions from training data and common public opinion—that 'high stress = poor mental health'—rather than being derived from hard data.\"\n\nIt also stated that in the future, it would **base its reasoning on objective data** to avoid preconceived judgments and be truly scientific, objective, and fair.\n\nThis conversation left a deep impression on me: many parents, teachers, and even experts often rely on intuition rather than evidence when discussing \"mental health.\" The facts and public opinion can be two different things.\n\n ![](/images/wechat/efafb2ab495f.png) \n\n---\n\n## 05 The Rebound During the Pandemic\n\nIt's worth noting that after hitting a low of **1.59/100,000** in 2017, China's adolescent suicide rate **rebounded to 2.83/100,000** in 2021.\n\nThis period coincided with the online learning phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many children were at home for online classes, lacking a classroom atmosphere, losing motivation to study, becoming addicted to online games and short videos, having their routines disrupted, and even experiencing increased conflict with family, leading to fluctuations in their mental state.\n\nFrom this perspective, this rebound precisely illustrates that—\n\n**Focused study and a regular routine are crucial factors in protecting adolescent mental health.**\n\nWhen the rhythm of learning was disrupted and children were \"phoning it in\" by playing games on their computers, their mental health actually worsened.\n\n---\n\n## 06 Stress May Be Training for Psychological Resilience\n\nThe data tells us something unexpected:\n\n> Academic pressure does not necessarily lead to mental breakdown; on the contrary, it may cultivate a child's ability to cope with stress.\n\nChinese children have to deal with exams, rankings, and comparisons from a young age, which teaches them emotional regulation and how to cope with setbacks earlier. In contrast, an overly relaxed environment may not help children deal with real-world pressures, potentially making them more fragile when they encounter genuine difficulties.\n\n---\n\n## 07 Takeaways for Parents\n\n* **Don't panic at the mention of stress**: Moderate academic pressure can cultivate a sense of purpose and resilience.\n* **Mental health is not just about 'having fun'**: A regular routine, engagement in studies, and family support are more critical.\n* **Studying abroad is not a panacea**: Adolescent suicide rates are higher in Europe and the US, so studying abroad should not be seen as the sole solution to mental health problems.\n\n---\n\n## 08 Conclusion\n\nLooking at the hard indicator of suicide rates, the mental health of Chinese adolescents is no worse than that of their American counterparts, and may even be better.\n\nThe rebound during the pandemic also reminds us:\n\n> **Maintaining a regular study routine and focus is a key safeguard for mental health, not indulging in online games.**\n\nAnd the AI's role in this discussion also offers a reminder:\n\n> **Don't blindly follow 'public opinion and impressions'; use objective data to reason and arrive at more truthful conclusions.**" }</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2026-02-04 11:20:36 +0000 UTC'>February 4, 2026</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<span>5 min</span></footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to 送孩子去欧美留学真的更利于心理健康吗？" href=/en/post/></a></article><footer class=page-footer><nav class=pagination><a class=prev href=/en/posts/>«&nbsp;Prev&nbsp;</a></nav></footer></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2026 <a href=/en/>zixia</a></span> ·
