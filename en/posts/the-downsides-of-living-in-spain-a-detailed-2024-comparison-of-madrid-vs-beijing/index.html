Mobile Communication Network Quality and Tariff Comparison Network Coverage and Signal Strength: According to data from institutions like Speedtest Intelligence and OpenSignal, Beijing outperforms Madrid in both the prevalence and stability of 5G and 4G networks. Beijing’s 5G coverage exceeds 95%, whereas Madrid still has signal dead zones in some urban areas and even indoors. Price for a 30GB Data Plan: Madrid: Average monthly fee is around €25–30 (¥200–240), with legacy carriers like Movistar and Vodafone being more expensive. Beijing: The average monthly price for a 30GB data + calls plan from China Mobile/Unicom/Telecom is about ¥60–80. Mobile communication costs in Spain are about 3 times higher than in China, and network coverage and signal stability are also relatively poor.\nConclusion From the comparison of the 19 specific life indicators above, it is clear that Spain (especially Madrid) lags behind Beijing in almost every aspect, including consumer costs, public service efficiency, educational quality, transportation convenience, and daily maintenance services. Although Spain boasts a beautiful natural environment and a slower pace of life, its high cost of living and inefficient allocation of public resources cannot be ignored.\nParticularly noteworthy is the higher education admissions policy. Universities in Europe and America, including those in Spain, widely practice a “diversity admissions” system. Admission criteria are not solely based on academic scores but also heavily consider the applicant’s race and ethnicity. People of East Asian descent (Chinese), due to their generally excellent exam scores, are paradoxically classified as a “non-disadvantaged group” and face stricter scrutiny in the competition.\nData shows:\nThe average IB score for many international schools in Beijing is between 35–38. Most schools in Madrid have an average score of only around 31–34. Although students of Chinese descent achieve excellent scores, in internationally standardized tests like the IB and A-Levels, which use a globally uniform exam and grading system, the admission standards are identical. In this context, applying to universities from China is more advantageous than applying locally from Spain, as Chinese students generally have higher overall scores and are more competitive. It is important to note that even Chinese students who have obtained Spanish citizenship are still considered “East Asian” in the diversity admissions system. Therefore, they are held to the same standard as applicants from China, with scores ultimately being the key determining factor.\nIn summary, Chinese families considering moving to, studying in, or making long-term investments in Spain need to conduct a comprehensive and rational assessment of its high cost of living, slow-paced administrative system, and the latent inequalities in its education and employment policies.\nAppendix: Madrid vs. Beijing Key Life Indicators Comparison Table (2024) Comparison Item Madrid Beijing Coca-Cola (500ml) €1.50 ≈ ¥12.3 ¥3 Big Mac Burger €5.65 ≈ ¥43 ¥25.5 95-Octane Gasoline (per liter) €1.57 ≈ ¥12 ¥7.9 Water Bill (per m³) €1.0–2.63 (¥7.6–20) ¥7.9 Electricity Bill (per kWh) €0.14 ≈ ¥1.2 ¥0.49 Natural Gas (per kWh) €0.091 ≈ ¥0.7 ¥0.26 Teacher Absenteeism Rate As high as 20% Extremely low Average IB Score Approx. 33 Approx. 36 Four-Star Hotel ¥2,172 ¥569 AC Installation Fee ¥2,500 ¥80–200 (usually free) Total AC Price ¥6,800 ¥2,500–3,200 High-Speed Rail Speed 200 km/h Approx. 300 km/h High-Speed Rail Fare (per km) ¥1.2–2.4 ¥0.46–0.48 Wait for Hospital Specialist Average 95 days Usually 1–7 days Volkswagen Golf 1.4L Price ¥243,000 ¥152,263 Two-Bedroom Rent (City Center) ¥9,200–15,300 ¥4,000–8,000 Metro Single Fare ¥11–15 ¥3 Kitchen Drain Unclogging Fee ¥1,200–4,000 (emergency ¥10,800) ¥80–200 (emergency not over ¥300) 30GB Mobile Plan ¥200–240 ¥60–80 5G Signal Coverage Weak/unstable in some areas Nearly full city coverage ","wordCount":"1247","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","dateModified":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"/en/posts/the-downsides-of-living-in-spain-a-detailed-2024-comparison-of-madrid-vs-beijing/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"zixia","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=/en/ accesskey=h title="zixia (Alt + H)">zixia</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">

Although Spain boasts a beautiful natural environment and a slower pace of life, its high cost of living and inefficient allocation of public resources cannot be ignored.</p><p>Particularly noteworthy is the higher education admissions policy. Universities in Europe and America, including those in Spain, widely practice a &ldquo;diversity admissions&rdquo; system. Admission criteria are not solely based on academic scores but also heavily consider the applicant&rsquo;s race and ethnicity. People of East Asian descent (Chinese), due to their generally excellent exam scores, are paradoxically classified as a &ldquo;non-disadvantaged group&rdquo; and face stricter scrutiny in the competition.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Data shows:</strong></p><ul><li>The average IB score for many international schools in Beijing is between 35–38.</li><li>Most schools in Madrid have an average score of only around 31–34.</li></ul></blockquote><blockquote><p>Although students of Chinese descent achieve excellent scores, in internationally standardized tests like the IB and A-Levels, which use a globally uniform exam and grading system, the admission standards are identical. In this context, applying to universities from China is more advantageous than applying locally from Spain, as Chinese students generally have higher overall scores and are more competitive. It is important to note that even Chinese students who have obtained Spanish citizenship are still considered &ldquo;East Asian&rdquo; in the diversity admissions system. Therefore, they are held to the same standard as applicants from China, with scores ultimately being the key determining factor.</p></blockquote><p>In summary, Chinese families considering moving to, studying in, or making long-term investments in Spain need to conduct a comprehensive and rational assessment of its high cost of living, slow-paced administrative system, and the latent inequalities in its education and employment policies.</p><hr><h2 id=appendix-madrid-vs-beijing-key-life-indicators-comparison-table-2024><strong>Appendix: Madrid vs. Beijing Key Life Indicators Comparison Table (2024)</strong><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#appendix-madrid-vs-beijing-key-life-indicators-comparison-table-2024>#</a></h2><table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:left>Comparison Item</th><th style=text-align:left>Madrid</th><th style=text-align:left>Beijing</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:left><strong>Coca-Cola (500ml)</strong></td><td style=text-align:left>€1.50 ≈ ¥12.3</td><td style=text-align:left>¥3</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left><strong>Big Mac Burger</strong></td><td style=text-align:left>€5.65 ≈ ¥43</td><td style=text-align:left>¥25.5</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left><strong>95-Octane Gasoline (per liter)</strong></td><td style=text-align:left>€1.57 ≈ ¥12</td><td style=text-align:left>¥7.9</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left><strong>Water Bill (per m³)</strong></td><td style=text-align:left>€1.0–2.63 (¥7.6–20)</td><td style=text-align:left>¥7.9</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left><strong>Electricity Bill (per kWh)</strong></td><td style=text-align:left>€0.14 ≈ ¥1.2</td><td style=text-align:left>¥0.49</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left><strong>Natural Gas (per kWh)</strong></td><td style=text-align:left>€0.091 ≈ ¥0.7</td><td style=text-align:left>¥0.26</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left><strong>Teacher Absenteeism Rate</strong></td><td style=text-align:left>As high as 20%</td><td style=text-align:left>Extremely low</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left><strong>Average IB Score</strong></td><td style=text-align:left>Approx. 33</td><td style=text-align:left>Approx. 36</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left><strong>Four-Star Hotel</strong></td><td style=text-align:left>¥2,172</td><td style=text-align:left>¥569</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left><strong>AC Installation Fee</strong></td><td style=text-align:left>¥2,500</td><td style=text-align:left>¥80–200 (usually free)</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left><strong>Total AC Price</strong></td><td style=text-align:left>¥6,800</td><td style=text-align:left>¥2,500–3,200</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left><strong>High-Speed Rail Speed</strong></td><td style=text-align:left>200 km/h</td><td style=text-align:left>Approx. 300 km/h</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left><strong>High-Speed Rail Fare (per km)</strong></td><td style=text-align:left>¥1.2–2.4</td><td style=text-align:left>¥0.46–0.48</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left><strong>Wait for Hospital Specialist</strong></td><td style=text-align:left>Average 95 days</td><td style=text-align:left>Usually 1–7 days</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left><strong>Volkswagen Golf 1.4L Price</strong></td><td style=text-align:left>¥243,000</td><td style=text-align:left>¥152,263</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left><strong>Two-Bedroom Rent (City Center)</strong></td><td style=text-align:left>¥9,200–15,300</td><td style=text-align:left>¥4,000–8,000</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left><strong>Metro Single Fare</strong></td><td style=text-align:left>¥11–15</td><td style=text-align:left>¥3</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left><strong>Kitchen Drain Unclogging Fee</strong></td><td style=text-align:left>¥1,200–4,000 (emergency ¥10,800)</td><td style=text-align:left>¥80–200 (emergency not over ¥300)</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left><strong>30GB Mobile Plan</strong></td><td style=text-align:left>¥200–240</td><td style=text-align:left>¥60–80</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left><strong>5G Signal Coverage</strong></td><td style=text-align:left>Weak/unstable in some areas</td><td style=text-align:left>Nearly full city coverage</td></tr></tbody></table></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul></footer></article></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2026 <a href=/en/>zixia</a></span> ·
