The ancient Greeks, on the other hand, raised a group of ‘superpowered giant babies’ on Mount Olympus. Zeus and his family, doing no real work, were busy every day with affairs and feuds. But in the end, a more efficient and monopolistic business model emerged:\nMonotheism\nThis logic is extremely self-consistent— there is only one ‘Big Boss’ in the heavens, and the mortal world only needs one ‘CEO’.\nAnd the founder of this monopolistic enterprise was—Abraham (also known as Ibrahim).\nI. A Family Feud: A Soap Opera That Changed Geopolitics All major events that changed the world might have initially started simply because—\nThe first wife couldn’t have children.\nAbraham was a successful entrepreneur, but he had a secret sorrow: his first wife, Sarah, was infertile.\nAnd so—\nHe had his firstborn son with the handmaiden Hagar: Ishmael. Later, his first wife miraculously became pregnant and gave birth to a second son: Isaac. To avoid a family inheritance dispute, Hagar and her son were exiled to the desert.\nThis ‘dispute between the legitimate and illegitimate heirs’ became the most expensive family separation in human history:\nIsaac (the legitimate second son) → became the ancestor of the Jewish people → and incidentally produced Moses and Jesus among his descendants. Ishmael (the illegitimate firstborn son) → became the ancestor of the Arab people → and from his descendants emerged the Prophet Muhammad. A miraculous scientific coincidence: modern genetics (Y-chromosome haplogroups) has surprisingly corroborated this legend—\nJews are predominantly J2. Arabs are predominantly J1. These two genetic groups indeed shared the same ‘father’ 4000 years ago.\nSo it turns out, the earth-shattering conflict in the Middle East today is, in essence, just two brothers beating each other up over the inheritance rights to the ancestral home.\nII. Product Iteration: A History of ‘Re-skinning’ from 1.0 to 3.0 Although the family split, the underlying code of the three brothers is actually the same.\nThe evolution of these three major religions is, in essence, the continuous upgrading of the same piece of software.\nJudaism | Bedrock Edition 1.0 The core is the Old Testament. A VIP, invitation-only product. Jews consider themselves God’s ’exclusive beta testers’. Arrogant, exclusive, and basically doesn’t accept new users. Christianity | Overseas Promotion Edition 2.0 Jesus appeared.\nIn his capacity as ‘God’s spokesperson’, he transformed the product from ‘For Jews Only’ to ‘Globally Compatible’.\n⚠️ Here comes the key point:\nJesus himself never wrote a single word.\nThe New Testament we see is a ‘memoir’ written by his followers decades later.\nThis means: from its inception, Christianity has been a history of interpretation.\nIslam | Ultimate Patch Edition 3.0 Muhammad believed:\nThe first two versions were ruined by the ‘product managers’.\nSo he directly released the final revised edition—the Quran.\nA grand ’localization’ in action:\nAbraham → Ibrahim Jesus → Isa Mary → Maryam The logic is simple:\nMy big brothers have misread the scriptures, so I’ve come to set the record straight.\nIII. The Art of Interpretation: How Did Polygamy ‘Disappear’? Since the scripts are more or less the same, why are their ways of life worlds apart?\nThe answer is just one sentence:\nThe text is dead, but the right to interpret it is alive.\nTake ‘polygamy’ as an example.\nMany people think this is a ‘perk’ of a certain religion, but its originator is actually Judaism.\nIn Exodus 21:10, God even thoughtfully laid out a ‘Guide to Taking Concubines’:\n“If he takes another wife to himself, he shall not diminish her food, her clothing, or her marital rights.”\nKing Solomon married 700 wives, and God didn’t expel him.\nSo why do Christians practice monogamy now?\nChristianity’s ‘will to survive’ In order to proselytize in the Roman Empire, which practiced monogamy, it directly used its power of interpretation to forcibly change the rules. Judaism’s ‘going with the flow’ It wasn’t until around 1000 AD that polygamy was formally abolished. The scriptures didn’t change; the CEO, in order to adapt to the market, made a breach-of-contract interpretation of a contract from thousands of years ago.\n","wordCount":"718","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","dateModified":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"/en/posts/from-abraham-s-family-feud-to-the-one-god-that-influenced-the-globe/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"zixia","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=/en/ accesskey=h title="zixia (Alt + H)">zixia</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
