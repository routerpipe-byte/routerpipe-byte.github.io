Must be rhinitis.” 🧠“Coughing? It’s just a cold.” 🧠“Headache? I’ll just take a painkiller.” And then they start self-diagnosing and self-medicating.\nBut in reality, many different illnesses can present with the exact same symptoms.\nIf you don’t figure out the root cause and only treat the symptoms, it might not only be ineffective but could also make things worse.\n🧪 I Thought It Was Allergic Rhinitis, But It Was Actually Vasomotor Rhinitis—Completely Different Medications, One for Desensitization, the Other Corticosteroids I’m a classic example. Whenever I smell strong odors like perfume, cooking fumes, or dust, I immediately get a stuffy nose, start sneezing, and have a runny nose. It’s especially noticeable during sudden temperature changes in the morning and evening or when the air is dry.\nMy immediate thought was: “This must be allergic rhinitis.”\nSo, I used a Japanese nasal spray:\n✅ Sato ナザール Spray 👉 Contains a vasoconstrictor (naphazoline), which clears your nose in minutes. The effect was magical at first. One spray and I could breathe freely, as if I was “cured.”\nBut problems soon followed:\n😵 Once I stopped using it, the congestion became even worse. My nasal passages were constantly congested and swollen, making it hard to sleep at night and even difficult to speak during the day.\n🔍 A Check-up Revealed: Not Allergies, But Vasomotor Rhinitis I couldn’t stand it anymore, so I went to the hospital for a series of tests:\n✅ Allergy skin prick test: Negative ✅ IgE blood test: Normal The final diagnosis was: Vasomotor Rhinitis\n✔️ Not an immune system issue ✔️ Anti-allergy medications are ineffective ✔️ Vasoconstrictor sprays can actually worsen the condition! ⚠️ Vasoconstrictors: Temporary Relief, Long-Term Worsening Common sprays like Sato Nazal, Otrivin, and Di Tong Bi Yan Shui almost all contain vasoconstrictor ingredients (like naphazoline, xylometazoline).\nThey work by:\nRapidly constricting nasal blood vessels → Relieving congestion → Providing temporary relief\nBut what happens with long-term use?\n🚨 The nasal passages become less and less sensitive to the medication. 🚨 Blood vessels experience rebound dilation after stopping the medication. 🚨 This leads to “rebound congestion.” 🚨 Over time, it develops into “rhinitis medicamentosa” (drug-induced rhinitis). 📄 The Patient Information Leaflet Isn’t Just for Show: Read It Carefully! Many people buy medicine looking only at its effects, without reading the instructions.\nIn fact, the drug’s leaflet clearly states:\n⚠️ “Do not use continuously for more than 5-7 days” ⚠️ “Limited number of uses per day” ⚠️ “Long-term use can lead to rhinitis medicamentosa” These aren’t just formalities; they are warnings based on clinical experience.\nFast-acting drugs are not a cure and cannot replace a proper long-term treatment plan.\n😷 ‘A Cold’ Is Not a Diagnosis, But a Set of Symptoms “A cold” is everyday language, not a medical diagnosis. When you experience symptoms like coughing, fever, or a runny nose, the actual cause could be one of many things:\n🦠 Viral infections (like rhinovirus, coronavirus, etc.) 🧫 Bacterial infections (like streptococcus) 🌬 Allergic reactions (like pollen, dust mites) 🌫 Irritants in the air (like smog, cold air) Same symptoms, different causes.\nIf you take medicine based solely on the idea that you “have a cold,” you’re very likely taking the wrong one.\n🥶 ‘You Caught a Chill’ ≠ The Real Cause We are too used to saying things like:\n🗣“Did you catch a cold?” 🗣“Did you catch a chill?”\nBut you need to know:\n✅ ‘A cold’ is just a collection of symptoms. ✅ ‘Catching a chill’ is just a possible trigger. ❌ Neither of them is the actual cause of the illness. What is the real cause?\n✔️ Rhinovirus ✔️ Coronavirus ✔️ Influenza virus ✔️ Streptococcus ✔️ Other pathogens ‘Catching a chill’ simply causes a temporary drop in your body’s immunity, opening the ‘door’ for these pathogens.\nSo, it’s not the cold wind that makes you sick, but the cold wind that makes it easier for viruses to get in.\n🧩 A Few Examples to Make It Clear: 🚨 Common Symptom 🧬 Possible Causes Stuffy Nose / Sneezing / Runny Nose Allergic rhinitis, vasomotor rhinitis, viral infection, sinusitis, air irritants Headache Migraine, cervicogenic headache, cold, insufficient blood supply to the brain, anxiety Cough Cold, bronchitis, asthma, gastroesophageal reflux, allergies Fever Flu, bacterial infection, autoimmune disease, vaccine reaction Stomachache Gastritis, ulcer, H. pylori infection, anxiety Behind every symptom could be a different disease; you can’t rely on intuition.\n⏱ Many Medications Require a Full ‘Course of Treatment’—Don’t Stop Just Because You Feel Better! This is another point many people overlook:\n📍 Antibiotics, nasal corticosteroids, antiviral drugs, medications for chronic inflammation… 📍 All require a complete course of treatment, taken according to the prescribed days and dosage. ❗️Don’t stop taking them just because you ‘feel a bit better.’ ❗️Don’t switch medications arbitrarily just because you ‘don’t feel right.’ Otherwise, it could lead to:\nSymptoms recurring The illness lingering and not fully healing Development of drug resistance, making future treatment more difficult Scientific treatment follows a process: ‘Lab tests → Determine the cause → Treat the cause → See effects → Consolidate treatment → Full recovery.’ Skipping any step can render all previous efforts useless.\n📚 We Are Entering the Era of ‘Evidence-Based Medicine’ In the past, when seeing a doctor or buying medicine, many people relied on ’experience,’ ‘word-of-mouth,’ or ‘what worked for so-and-so.’\nToday, medicine has entered a more scientific era: 👉 Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM)\nWhat does this mean?\n✅ Using real clinical data to guide treatment ✅ Verifying drug efficacy through scientific experiments ✅ Assessing risks with statistical models ✅ Making decisions based on research conclusions, not ‘feelings’ 🧪 Whether a Drug Is Effective Can’t Be Based on ‘Hearsay’ For a drug to be approved, it must undergo a rigorous medical validation process:\nAnimal studies + Pharmacological mechanism research Phase I-III clinical trials: Including randomized, double-blind, and control groups Toxicity analysis and long-term observation Pharmacokinetic analysis: Understanding how the drug is absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and excreted in the body In particular, the Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) is the gold standard for testing a drug’s efficacy: Neither the doctors nor the patients know whether they are receiving the drug or a placebo, ensuring the results are reliable and unbiased.\n🧬 Pharmacological Mechanisms + Etiological Research = The Foundation of Precision Medicine Anti-allergy drugs target the histamine release mechanism. Antibiotics are categorized to attack specific bacteria. Antiviral drugs precisely interrupt the viral replication cycle. Biologic targeted drugs and immunotherapy drugs directly address the root of cellular pathology. This isn’t about ‘who it worked for in the past,’ but about: 📊 Scientific basis + Experimental data + Clear mechanisms + Clinical confirmation\n✅ The Correct Approach to Treatment (A Summary) 🔎 Don’t just buy and take medicine as soon as symptoms appear. 🧠 Don’t ‘self-diagnose’ based on experience. 📋 Instead—\nInvestigate the cause, don’t just look at the symptoms. Get tests done, don’t rely on subjective feelings. Follow your doctor’s advice, don’t take medicine randomly. Read the instructions: usage, dosage, and duration are all important. Complete the full course of treatment; don’t stop on your own. ✅ Use evidence-based medicine to guide every treatment decision. 📌 A Final Word: Next time you say, “My rhinitis is acting up again” or “I have a cold,” ask yourself first:\n“Do I really know what illness I have?”\n🧩 Symptom ≠ Diagnosis 🧩 Appearance ≠ Essence 🧩 Experience ≠ Evidence 🧩 Feeling ≠ Science Using an evidence-based mindset to identify the cause, treat it accordingly, and complete the full course of treatment is how you truly take responsibility for your health.\nIf you know someone who always ‘self-diagnoses,’ misuses sprays, or stops treatment midway, 👉 please forward this article to them.\nFeel free to give this a ‘Like’ 👍 to help more people realize— Experience cannot replace science, intuition cannot replace tests, symptoms cannot hide the truth, and treatment must be based on evidence.\n","wordCount":"1350","inLanguage":"zh","datePublished":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","dateModified":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"/en/same-symptoms-different-causes-don-t-let-intuition-delay-your-treatment/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"zixia","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=/zh/ accesskey=h title="zixia (Alt + H)">zixia</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
