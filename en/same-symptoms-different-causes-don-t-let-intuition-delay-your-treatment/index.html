Must be rhinitis.” 🧠 “Coughing? It’s just a cold.” 🧠 “Headache? I’ll just take a painkiller.” Then they begin to self-diagnose and self-medicate.\nBut the truth is, many different illnesses can present with the exact same symptoms.\nIf you don’t figure out the root cause and only treat the symptoms, it’s not just ineffective—it could make things worse.\n🧪 I Thought It Was Allergic Rhinitis, But It Was Vasomotor Rhinitis. The Medications Are Completely Different: One for Desensitization, the Other for Glucocorticoids. I’m a classic example. Whenever I smell strong odors like perfume, cooking fumes, or dust, I immediately get a stuffy nose, sneeze, and have a runny nose. It’s especially noticeable during drastic temperature changes in the morning and evening or when the air is dry.\nMy subconscious reaction was: “This must be allergic rhinitis.”\nSo, I used a Japanese nasal spray:\n✅ Sato ナザール Spray 👉 Contains a vasoconstrictor ingredient (naphazoline), which clears the nose within minutes. At first, the effect was magical. One spray and my nose was clear, as if I was “cured.”\nBut problems soon followed:\n😵 Once I stopped the medication, the congestion became even worse. My nasal passages were repeatedly congested and swollen. I couldn’t sleep well at night and had trouble speaking during the day.\n🔍 A Check-up Revealed: Not Allergies, But Vasomotor Rhinitis Unable to bear it any longer, I went to the hospital for a series of tests:\n✅ Allergen skin prick test: Negative ✅ IgE blood test: Normal The final diagnosis was: Vasomotor Rhinitis\n✔️ Not an immune system problem ✔️ Anti-allergy medications are ineffective ✔️ Vasoconstrictor sprays can worsen the condition! ⚠️ Vasoconstrictors: Temporary Relief, Long-Term Worsening Common sprays like Sato Nazal, Otrivin, and other decongestant nasal drops almost all contain vasoconstrictor ingredients (like naphazoline, xylometazoline).\nTheir mechanism of action is:\nRapidly constricting nasal blood vessels → Relieving congestion → Providing temporary relief\nBut what happens with long-term use?\n🚨 The nasal passages become less and less sensitive to the drug. 🚨 Rebound dilation of blood vessels occurs after stopping the medication. 🚨 “Rebound congestion” appears. 🚨 Over time, it develops into “rhinitis medicamentosa” (drug-induced rhinitis). 📄 The Instructions Aren’t Just for Show: Read Them Carefully! Many people only look at the effects when buying medicine and ignore the instructions.\nIn fact, the drug’s instructions clearly state:\n⚠️ “Do not use continuously for more than 5-7 days.” ⚠️ “Limited number of uses per day.” ⚠️ “Long-term use can lead to drug-induced rhinitis.” These are not formalities but warnings based on clinical experience.\nFast-acting drugs are not a cure and cannot replace a proper long-term treatment plan.\n😷 “A Cold” Is Not a Diagnosis, But a Group of Symptoms “A cold” is everyday language, not a medical diagnosis. When symptoms like coughing, fever, and a runny nose appear, the actual cause could be one of many things:\n🦠 Viral infections (e.g., rhinovirus, coronavirus) 🧫 Bacterial infections (e.g., streptococcus) 🌬 Allergic reactions (e.g., pollen, dust mites) 🌫 Air irritants (e.g., smog, cold air) Same symptoms, different causes.\nIf you take medicine based solely on the words “I have a cold,” you’re likely taking the wrong one.\n🥶 “You Caught a Chill” ≠ The Real Cause We are too accustomed to phrases like:\n🗣 “Did you catch a cold?” 🗣 “Did you get a chill?”\nBut you need to know:\n✅ “A cold” is just a collection of symptoms. ✅ “Catching a chill” is just a possible trigger. ❌ Neither is the cause itself. What is the real cause?\n✔️ Rhinovirus ✔️ Coronavirus ✔️ Influenza virus ✔️ Streptococcus ✔️ Other pathogens “Catching a chill” merely causes a temporary drop in your body’s immunity, opening the door for these pathogens.\nSo, it’s not the cold wind that makes you sick, but the cold wind that makes it easier for viruses to get in.\n🧩 A Few Examples to Make It Clear: 🚨 Common Symptom 🧬 Possible Causes Nasal congestion / Sneezing / Runny nose Allergic rhinitis, Vasomotor rhinitis, Viral infection, Sinusitis, Air irritation Headache Migraine, Cervicogenic headache, Common cold, Insufficient blood supply to the brain, Anxiety Cough Common cold, Bronchitis, Asthma, Gastroesophageal reflux, Allergies Fever Influenza, Bacterial infection, Autoimmune disease, Vaccine reaction Stomach pain Gastritis, Ulcer, Helicobacter pylori infection, Anxiety Behind every symptom could be a different disease; you can’t rely on intuition.\n⏱ Many Medications Require a Full “Course of Treatment,” Don’t Stop Just Because You Feel Better! This is another point many people overlook:\n📍 Antibiotics, nasal steroid sprays, antiviral drugs, medications for chronic inflammation… 📍 All require a complete course of treatment, taken on schedule and in the correct dosage. ❗️Don’t stop just because you “feel a bit better.” ❗️Don’t switch medications arbitrarily because you “feel uncomfortable.” Otherwise, it could lead to:\nRecurring symptoms A prolonged, unresolved illness Development of drug resistance, making future treatment more difficult Scientific treatment involves a process: “Lab tests → Determine the cause → Targeted treatment → Onset of effect → Consolidation → Recovery.” Skipping any stage can undo all previous efforts.\n📚 We Are Entering the Era of “Evidence-Based Medicine” In the past, seeing a doctor or buying medicine was often based on “experience,” “reputation,” or “what worked for so-and-so.”\nToday, medicine has entered a more scientific era: 👉 Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM)\nWhat does this mean?\n✅ Using real clinical data to guide treatment ✅ Verifying drug efficacy through scientific experiments ✅ Assessing risks with statistical models ✅ Making decisions based on research conclusions, not “feelings” 🧪 Is a Drug Really Effective? You Can’t Rely on “Hearsay” For a drug to be approved, it must undergo a rigorous medical validation process:\nAnimal experiments + Pharmacological mechanism research Phase I-III clinical trials: Including randomization, double-blinding, and control groups Toxicity analysis and long-term observation Pharmacokinetic analysis: Understanding how the drug is absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and excreted in the body Especially the double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT), which is the gold standard for testing drug efficacy: Neither the doctor nor the patient knows whether they are receiving the drug or a placebo, ensuring the results are reliable.\n🧬 Pharmacological Mechanisms + Etiological Research = The Foundation of Precision Medicine Anti-allergy drugs target the histamine release mechanism. Antibiotics are categorized to attack specific bacteria. Antiviral drugs precisely interrupt the viral replication cycle. Biologic targeted drugs and immunotherapy drugs directly address the root of cellular pathology. This isn’t about “who was cured by this before,” but about: 📊 Scientific basis + Experimental data + Clear mechanisms + Clinical confirmation\n✅ The Correct Approach to Treatment (A Summary) 🔎 Don’t just buy medicine as soon as symptoms appear. 🧠 Don’t “self-diagnose” based on experience. 📋 Instead—\nFind the cause, don’t just look at the symptoms. Get tested, don’t rely on subjective feelings. Follow medical advice, don’t self-medicate randomly. Read the instructions: usage, dosage, and duration are all important. Stick to the full course of treatment; don’t stop on your own. ✅ Use evidence-based medicine to guide every treatment decision. 📌 In Conclusion: Next time you say, “My rhinitis is acting up again” or “I have a cold,” first ask yourself:\n“Do I really know what illness I have?”\n🧩 Symptom ≠ Diagnosis 🧩 Appearance ≠ Essence 🧩 Experience ≠ Evidence 🧩 Feeling ≠ Science Using the mindset of evidence-based medicine to identify the cause, treat the problem correctly, and complete the full course of therapy is how you truly take responsibility for your health.\nIf you know someone who always “self-diagnoses,” misuses sprays, or stops treatment early, 👉 Please share this article with them.\nExperience cannot replace science, intuition cannot replace examination, symptoms cannot hide the truth, and treatment must be based on evidence.\n","wordCount":"1316","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","dateModified":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"/en/same-symptoms-different-causes-don-t-let-intuition-delay-your-treatment/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"zixia","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=/en/ accesskey=h title="zixia (Alt + H)">zixia</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
