Whenever I smell strong odors like perfume, cooking fumes, or dust, I immediately get a stuffy nose, sneeze, and have a runny nose. It’s especially noticeable during large temperature swings in the morning and evening or when the air is dry.\nMy subconscious reaction was: **“This must be allergic rhinitis.”\nSo, I used a Japanese nasal spray:\n✅ Sato ナザール Spray 👉 Contains a vasoconstrictor (naphazoline), which clears the nose within minutes. At first, the effect was magical. One spray and my nose was clear, as if I was “cured.”\nBut problems soon followed:\n😵 Once I stopped the medication, the nasal congestion became even more severe. My nasal passages were repeatedly congested and swollen, making it hard to sleep at night and difficult to speak during the day.\n🔍 A Check-up Revealed: Not Allergies, But Vasomotor Rhinitis I couldn’t stand it anymore, so I went to the hospital for a series of tests:\n✅ Allergen skin test: Negative ✅ IgE blood test: Normal The final diagnosis was: Vasomotor Rhinitis\n✔️ Not an immune system problem ✔️ Anti-allergy medications are ineffective ✔️ Vasoconstrictor sprays can worsen the condition! ⚠️ Vasoconstrictors: Temporary Relief, Worsening Later Common sprays like Sato Nazal, Otrivin, and others almost all contain vasoconstrictor ingredients (like naphazoline, xylometazoline).\nTheir mechanism of action is:\nTo rapidly constrict the blood vessels in the nasal cavity → Relieve congestion → Provide temporary relief\nBut what happens with long-term use?\n🚨 The nasal passages become less and less sensitive to the drug 🚨 Blood vessels experience rebound dilation after stopping the medication 🚨 “Rebound congestion” occurs 🚨 Over time, it develops into “medication-induced rhinitis” (rhinitis medicamentosa) 📄 The Instructions Aren’t Just for Show: Read Them Carefully! Many people only look at the effects when buying medicine and ignore the instructions.\nIn fact, the drug instructions clearly state:\n⚠️ “Do not use continuously for more than 5-7 days” ⚠️ “Limited number of uses per day” ⚠️ “Long-term use can lead to medication-induced rhinitis” These are not formalities but warnings based on clinical experience.\nFast-acting drugs are not a cure and cannot replace a proper long-term treatment plan.\n😷 “A Cold” Is Not a Diagnosis, But a Set of Symptoms “A cold” is everyday language, not a medical diagnosis. When symptoms like coughing, fever, and a runny nose appear, the actual cause could be one of many things:\n🦠 Viral infections (like rhinovirus, coronavirus, etc.) 🧫 Bacterial infections (like streptococcus) 🌬 Allergic reactions (like pollen, dust mites) 🌫 Air irritants (like smog, cold air) Same symptoms, different causes.\nIf you take medicine based solely on the words “I have a cold,” you’re likely taking the wrong one.\n🥶 “You Caught a Chill” ≠ The Real Cause We are too used to phrases like:\n🗣 “Did you catch a cold?” 🗣 “Did you catch a chill?”\nBut you need to know:\n✅ “A cold” is just a collection of symptoms ✅ “Catching a chill” is just a possible trigger ❌ Neither of them is the cause itself What is the real cause?\n✔️ Rhinovirus ✔️ Coronavirus ✔️ Influenza virus ✔️ Streptococcus ✔️ Other pathogens “Catching a chill” simply causes a temporary drop in your body’s immunity, opening the “door” for these pathogens.\nSo, it’s not the cold air that makes you sick, but the cold air making it easier for viruses to get in.\n🧩 A Few Examples to Make It Clear: 🚨 Common Symptom 🧬 Possible Causes Nasal Congestion / Sneezing / Runny Nose Allergic rhinitis, vasomotor rhinitis, viral infection, sinusitis, air irritants Headache Migraine, cervicogenic headache, common cold, cerebral ischemia, anxiety Cough Common cold, bronchitis, asthma, gastroesophageal reflux, allergies Fever Influenza, bacterial infection, autoimmune disease, vaccine reaction Stomachache Gastritis, ulcer, H. pylori infection, anxiety Behind every symptom could be a different disease; you can’t rely on intuition.\n⏱ Many Medications Require a Full ‘Course of Treatment’—Don’t Stop Just Because You Feel Better! This is another point many people overlook:\n📍 Antibiotics, nasal steroid sprays, antiviral drugs, medications for chronic inflammation… 📍 All require a complete course of treatment, taken on schedule and in the correct dosage. ❗️Don’t stop just because you “feel a bit better” ❗️Don’t switch medications arbitrarily because you “feel uncomfortable” Otherwise, it can lead to:\nRecurring symptoms A prolonged, unresolved illness The development of drug resistance, making future treatment more difficult Scientific treatment involves a process: “Lab tests → Determine the cause → Treat the cause → See effects → Consolidate treatment → Full recovery.” Skipping any stage can undo all previous efforts.\n📚 We Are Entering the Era of ‘Evidence-Based Medicine’ In the past, seeing a doctor or buying medicine was often based on “experience,” “reputation,” or “what worked for so-and-so.”\nToday, medicine has entered a more scientific era: 👉 Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM)\nWhat does this mean?\n✅ Using real clinical data to guide treatment ✅ Verifying drug efficacy through scientific experiments ✅ Assessing risks with statistical models ✅ Making decisions based on research conclusions, not “feelings” 🧪 Is a Drug Effective? You Can’t Rely on ‘Hearsay’ For a drug to be approved, it must undergo a rigorous medical validation process:\nAnimal experiments + Pharmacological mechanism research Phase I-III clinical trials: Including randomized, double-blind, and control groups Toxicity analysis and long-term observation Pharmacokinetic analysis: Understanding how the drug is absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and excreted in the body Especially the double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT), which is the gold standard for testing drug efficacy: Neither the doctor nor the patient knows who is receiving the drug and who is receiving a placebo, ensuring the results are reliable.\n🧬 Pharmacological Mechanisms + Etiological Research = The Foundation of Precision Medicine Anti-allergy drugs target the histamine release mechanism Antibiotics are categorized to attack specific bacteria Antiviral drugs precisely interrupt the viral replication cycle Biologic targeted drugs and immunotherapy drugs directly address the root of cellular pathology This isn’t about “who was cured by this before,” but about: 📊 Scientific basis + Experimental data + Clear mechanisms + Clinical confirmation\n✅ The Correct Approach to Treatment (A Summary) 🔎 Don’t just buy medicine as soon as symptoms appear 🧠 Don’t “self-diagnose” based on experience 📋 Instead—\nFind the cause, don’t just look at the symptoms Get tested, don’t rely on subjective feelings Follow medical advice, don’t self-medicate randomly Read the instructions: usage, dosage, and duration are all important Stick to the full course of treatment, don’t stop on your own ✅ Use evidence-based medicine to guide every treatment decision 📌 A Final Word: Next time you say “My rhinitis is acting up again” or “I have a cold,” ask yourself first:\n“Do I really know what illness I have?”\n🧩 Symptom ≠ Diagnosis 🧩 Appearance ≠ Essence 🧩 Experience ≠ Evidence 🧩 Feeling ≠ Science Using the mindset of evidence-based medicine to identify the cause, treat it correctly, and complete the full course of therapy is how you truly take responsibility for your health.\nIf you know someone who loves to “self-diagnose,” misuse sprays, or stop treatment early, 👉 Please forward this article to them.\nFeel free to give this a “Like” 👍 to help more people realize— Experience cannot replace science, intuition cannot replace examination, symptoms cannot hide the truth, and treatment must be based on evidence.\n","wordCount":"1338","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","dateModified":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"/en/same-symptoms-different-causes-don-t-let-intuition-delay-your-treatment/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"zixia","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=/en/ accesskey=h title="zixia (Alt + H)">zixia</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
