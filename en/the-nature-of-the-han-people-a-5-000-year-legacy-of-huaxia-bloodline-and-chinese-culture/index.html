The Records of the Grand Historian and Discourses of the States record:

The Yellow Emperor defeated the Yan Emperor at the Battle of Banquan, causing the Yan tribe to submit.
He then defeated Chiyou at the Battle of Zhuolu.

This is not merely a legend but a symbol of the integration of ancient tribes:

The Yellow Emperor&rsquo;s group: An agricultural tribe from the Central Plains, with the surname Ji.
The Yan Emperor&rsquo;s group: A tribe with the surname Jiang, related to the ancient Qiang people.
Chiyou&rsquo;s group: The Jiuli (Nine Li) tribes, ancestors of the Miao-Man peoples of the south.

Ultimately, the people of the Yan Emperor and Chiyou were incorporated into the Yellow Emperor&rsquo;s tribe, forming the &ldquo;Huaxia.&rdquo;"><meta name=author content><link rel=canonical href=/en/the-nature-of-the-han-people-a-5-000-year-legacy-of-huaxia-bloodline-and-chinese-culture/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.da3211e5ef867bf2b75fd5a6515cfed7195c011e8ab735694e203810a827097b.css integrity="sha256-2jIR5e+Ge/K3X9WmUVz+1xlcAR6KtzVpTiA4EKgnCXs=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=zh href=/zh/han-zu-de-min-zu-xing-zhi-hua-xia-xue-mai-yu-zhong-hua-wen-hua-de-wu-qian-nian-chuan-cheng/><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=/en/the-nature-of-the-han-people-a-5-000-year-legacy-of-huaxia-bloodline-and-chinese-culture/><link rel=alternate hreflang=es href=/es/la-naturaleza-etnica-del-pueblo-han-5000-anos-de-linaje-huaxia-y-herencia-cultural-china/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51);color-scheme:dark}.list{background:var(--theme)}.toc{background:var(--entry)}}@media(prefers-color-scheme:light){.list::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--code-bg)}}</style></noscript><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="dark":localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="light":window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches?document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="dark":document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="light"</script><script>(function(){var t,n,s,o="pref-theme",e=localStorage.getItem(o);if(e==="dark"||e==="light"){document.documentElement.classList.toggle("dark",e==="dark");return}t=(new Date).getHours(),n=t>=19||t<7,s=n,document.documentElement.classList.toggle("dark",s)})()</script><script>(function(){function e(e){localStorage.setItem("pref-theme",e),document.documentElement.classList.toggle("dark",e==="dark")}document.addEventListener("click",function(t){var n=t.target,s=n&&(n.id==="moon"?n:n.closest&&n.closest("#moon")),o=n&&(n.id==="sun"?n:n.closest&&n.closest("#sun"));s&&e("dark"),o&&e("light")})})()</script><style>.post-content img,.post-single img,article img{display:block;height:auto;width:min(100%,800px);margin:1rem auto;cursor:zoom-in}.hd-lightbox{position:fixed;inset:0;background:rgba(0,0,0,.85);display:none;align-items:center;justify-content:center;z-index:9999;padding:24px}.hd-lightbox.open{display:flex}.hd-lightbox img{max-width:min(96vw,1400px);max-height:92vh;width:auto;height:auto;cursor:zoom-out;border-radius:8px}.hd-lightbox .hint{position:fixed;top:12px;right:14px;font-size:12px;opacity:.75}</style><script>(function(){function e(e){document.readyState!=="loading"?e():document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",e)}e(function(){var t,e=document.createElement("div");e.className="hd-lightbox",e.innerHTML='<div class="hint">Click image / Press ESC to close</div><img alt=""/>',document.body.appendChild(e),t=e.querySelector("img");function n(){e.classList.remove("open"),t.src=""}e.addEventListener("click",n),document.addEventListener("keydown",function(e){e.key==="Escape"&&n()});function s(){var n=document.querySelectorAll(".post-content img, .post-single img, article img");n.forEach(function(n){if(n.dataset.hdBound)return;if(n.dataset.hdBound="1",n.naturalWidth&&n.naturalWidth<80||n.width&&n.width<80)return;n.addEventListener("click",function(s){s.preventDefault(),s.stopPropagation();var o=n.currentSrc||n.src;if(!o)return;t.src=o,e.classList.add("open")})})}s()})})()</script><meta property="og:url" content="/en/the-nature-of-the-han-people-a-5-000-year-legacy-of-huaxia-bloodline-and-chinese-culture/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="zixia"><meta property="og:title" content="The Nature of the Han People: A 5,000-Year Legacy of Huaxia Bloodline and Chinese Culture"><meta property="og:description" content="1.

Ultimately, the people of the Yan Emperor and Chiyou were incorporated into the Yellow Emperor’s tribe, forming the “Huaxia.”\n👉 From the very beginning, the Chinese nation was a civilizational community where diverse groups coexisted and eventually unified.\n2. The Origin of “Hua”: Flower and Mount Hua In ancient Chinese, “华” (huà) and “花” (huā, flower) were homophones. The flower symbolizes prosperity and was likely a totem of early tribes.\nMount Hua (华山), revered as the Western Great Mountain, is the sacred mountain of the “Hua people.”\nIn the Spring and Autumn period, the Book of Documents (“Successful Completion of the War”) already stated:\nThe Huaxia and the Man-Mo barbarians, there were none who did not follow and submit.\nThe Zuo Zhuan (“10th Year of Duke Ding”) says:\nDescendants of other regions should not plot against the Xia; barbarians should not disrupt the Hua.\nThis shows that “Huaxia” had already become the self-identity of the Central Plains civilization.\n👉 The mythical tribal alliance eventually transformed into a civilizational concept in written records.\n3. Evidence for the Xia: Yangshao, Longshan, Erlitou, and Liangzhu The Xia Dynasty was long considered a “legendary dynasty.”\nBut archaeological discoveries have gradually clarified history:\nYangshao Culture (c. 5000–3000 BCE, middle Yellow River): Best known for its painted pottery. It was primarily agricultural and formed the basis for the early Huaxia groups in the Central Plains. Longshan Culture (c. 3000–1900 BCE, lower Yellow River): Characterized by black pottery and the emergence of city sites. Social stratification intensified, and the early form of a state appeared, marking a key stage leading to the Xia. Erlitou Culture (c. 1900–1500 BCE, Yanshi, Henan): Featured palaces, roads, and bronze ritual vessels. Power was centralized, and it is widely believed to be associated with the Xia Dynasty, marking the entry of Huaxia into the “state era.” Meanwhile, the Yangtze River basin developed in parallel:\nLiangzhu Culture (c. 3300–2300 BCE, Zhejiang): Known for its jade civilization. Jade is a unique symbol of Chinese civilization. Its ritual system and social hierarchy were highly developed, earning it the title “proof of 5,000 years of Chinese civilization.” Ancient DNA studies show that the paternal lineage of the Liangzhu people was also dominated by Haplogroup O (mostly O1 and O2), closely related to the O-M122 of the Central Plains Han people. This indicates that the Liangzhu people were genetically related to the people of the Central Plains but followed a southern civilizational path. 👉 Conclusion: The Yangshao-Longshan-Erlitou sequence represents the direct lineage of the Xia Dynasty, while Liangzhu represents the peak of southern civilization. The parallel development of the north and south, eventually converging, formed the pluralistic yet unified structure of Huaxia civilization.\n4. Ancient DNA and the Paternal Lineage Imprint of East Asia Ancient DNA studies show:\nThe Yangshao-Longshan-Erlitou populations have genetic continuity with modern Han, Tibetan, and Qiang peoples. Components of the Liangzhu culture population still exist among southern Han Chinese and Miao-Yi ethnic groups. Over 70% of modern Han Chinese men belong to Haplogroup O (especially O-M122), which is the core paternal marker of the Han people.\nPaternal Lineage Comparison of Major East Asian Ethnic Groups Han Chinese: 70–80% Haplogroup O, the most concentrated. Tibetans: 50–60% Haplogroup O, with another 35–45% D-M174 (a remnant of an ancient East Asian indigenous paternal lineage). Qiang: Predominantly Haplogroup O, continuing ancient Qiang characteristics. Mongols: Predominantly C-M217 (50–60%), a typical marker of nomadic peoples. Manchu: Historically similar to Mongols, with C haplogroup being dominant. After entering the Central Plains, long-term intermarriage with Han Chinese has led to Haplogroup O being predominant today. Japanese: 40–50% Haplogroup O, 30–40% D-M174, with a small amount of C. Koreans: 60–70% Haplogroup O, with small amounts of C and N. European Comparison: About 60–70% Haplogroup R (mainly R1b in Western Europe, R1a in Eastern Europe), with Haplogroup I (10–20%) and smaller proportions of E/J/G. 👉 Conclusion: The Han Chinese Haplogroup O is the most stable and concentrated. Tibetans and Japanese retain a significant amount of the ancient D haplogroup. Mongols and Manchus were once dominated by C but eventually integrated into the larger O haplogroup system.\n5. Han, Tibetan, and Qiang: Same Origin, Different Branches The Han, Tibetans, and Qiang all originate from the ancient Qiang people:\nHan: One branch of the ancient Qiang entered the Yellow River basin, developed agriculture, and merged with the Yangshao-Longshan-Erlitou cultures to form the Han people (70–80% Haplogroup O). Tibetans: Another branch of the ancient Qiang moved onto the Tibetan Plateau, engaged in pastoralism, and merged with the Paleolithic indigenous population carrying D-M174, forming the Tibetan people (O ≈50–60%, D ≈35–45%). Qiang: The Qiang people in today’s Maoxian County, Sichuan (who call themselves “Rma”), are direct descendants of the ancient Qiang. 👉 The Han, Tibetans, and Qiang are fraternal peoples from the same origin but different branches. The Han are the largest branch, while the Tibetans and Qiang retain more ancient genes and unique cultures.\n6. Genetic Drift: The High Probability of Minority Genes Disappearing Why has the Han Haplogroup O persisted for thousands of years, while the genes of other ethnic groups have gradually dissipated?\nThe answer lies in genetic drift.\nGenetic drift refers to:\nMinority genes, having a very low proportion in a population, are susceptible to random fluctuations and are highly likely to disappear completely after a few generations. Majority genes, on the other hand, are more stable and become more entrenched with each passing generation. It’s like gamblers in a casino:\nLarge capital (majority genes) can withstand occasional losses. Small capital (minority genes) can be wiped out by a few fluctuations and eliminated. An Example from Human Evolution All humans today can be traced back to a single father, “Y-chromosomal Adam,” and a single mother, “Mitochondrial Eve.”\nThey were not the only people alive at the time, but:\nOther lineages were gradually absorbed or disappeared through genetic drift. Only their lineages survived to become the common ancestors of modern humans. Meanwhile, “hominin cousins” like Neanderthals and Denisovans eventually went extinct.\n👉 The pattern is clear: in ethnic fusion, minority genes disappear, and majority genes persist.\n7. Case Studies of Historical Peoples Turkic peoples: They once formed a powerful empire in Central Asia and were the ruling class of Turkey. However, the genes of modern Turkish people have almost no connection to East Asia. The Turkic bloodline has dissipated, leaving only the language. Xiongnu: They migrated west to Europe and established the “Hunnic Empire,” but modern Hungarians have almost no Xiongnu genes. Manchu: When they entered the Central Plains during the Qing Dynasty, their paternal lineage was mostly Haplogroup C. After three hundred years of integration, the paternal lineage of modern Manchus is almost identical to that of the Han, predominantly Haplogroup O. 👉 Historical facts confirm the principle of genetic drift: the genes of minority groups are ultimately absorbed by the majority group.\n8. The “Five Barbarians Uprising” and the Misconception of Admixture Many people say that after the “Uprising of the Five Barbarians,” the Han people were thoroughly mixed.\nBut the facts from genetic testing show the opposite:\nThe Han Haplogroup O still accounts for 70–80%, making it the most stable genetic structure in East Asia. The proportions of other components (C, N, etc.) are extremely low, far from enough to alter the main body. Historically, minority ethnic groups were ultimately assimilated by the Han, not the other way around. 👉 The truth is: The Han were not diluted; they continuously absorbed others into their main body.\nThis is why the Han people today still maintain a high stability of Haplogroup O.\n9. Religious Culture: Rationality and Inclusiveness Han culture, like its genetics, exhibits “stability + absorption.”\nShang Dynasty: Reverence for spirits and emphasis on sacrifice. Zhou Dynasty: The Duke of Zhou established rites, with ancestor worship at the core. Confucianism: “Respect ghosts and spirits but keep them at a distance,” focusing on human ethics and ritual governance. Han and Tang Dynasties: Buddhism, Daoism, and Confucianism coexisted. Song, Ming, and Qing Dynasties: Clan ancestral halls became deeply rooted at the grassroots level. Characteristics:\nAncestor Worship → The fusion of bloodline and culture. Rationalization → Religion incorporated into the ritual system. Inclusiveness → Ability to absorb foreign religions. Secularism → Openness to science and practical matters. 👉 The stability of the genes mirrors the rational and inclusive nature of the culture.\n10. The True Meaning of the Chinese Nation Linguistics: Chinese, Tibetan, Qiang, and Yi languages → All belong to the Sino-Tibetan language family. Genetics: The Han, Tibetan, and Qiang peoples share the O haplogroup from the ancient Qiang, just with different evolutionary paths. History and Culture: The Yan Emperor, Yellow Emperor, Chiyou, and Qiang people → All were eventually incorporated into the Huaxia civilization. 👉 The Chinese Nation (Zhonghua Minzu) = The Han people as the main body + a community of multiple ethnic minorities.\n11. Conclusion From myth to archaeology, from genetics to culture, the Han people exhibit a “threefold continuity”:\nUnbroken Historical Culture — 5,000 years of Huaxia, with an uninterrupted cultural lineage. Stable Bloodline and Genetics — Haplogroup O as the Han backbone, with a common origin for Tibetans and Qiang. Inclusive and Rational Culture — Foreign religions and cultures were all integrated. The cultural and genetic legacy of the Han people has a distinct ethnic character.\nHistorical culture and genetic tracing both prove that:\nThe Han people are the main body of the Chinese nation (Zhonghua Minzu), and the Chinese nation is a civilizational community of China’s multiple ethnic groups.\nOnly by examining genetics and history can we understand the origins of the Chinese nation.\n","wordCount":"1704","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","dateModified":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"/en/the-nature-of-the-han-people-a-5-000-year-legacy-of-huaxia-bloodline-and-chinese-culture/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"zixia","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=/en/ accesskey=h title="zixia (Alt + H)">zixia</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
