I had an in-depth discussion with an AI using data, and the conclusion might upend your assumptions.\n01 Starting with the Intuition that “Stress = Mental Health Problems” Initially, the AI’s response was like most people’s:\n“American education is more relaxed and thus more beneficial for adolescent mental health.”\nThe reasoning was: less stress â less anxiety â better mental health.\nThis sounds logical, but it’s based on impressions and speculation, not data.\nSo I pressed further: “Can we compare this using quantitative metrics, like depression rates or suicide rates?”\n02 Depression Rates: A Wide Discrepancy in Data The AI found data on adolescent depression rates in China and the US, revealing a huge statistical variance for China:\nMetric China United States Diagnosed Depressive Disorder â 2% (6â16 years, national review, Child \u0026 Adolescent Psychiatry \u0026 Mental Health 2024) â 19â20% (12â17 years, major depressive episode in the past year, NIMH / SAMHSA NSDUH 2021â2022) Symptom Screening (Blue Book) 14.8% (2022 edition), 24.6% (2020 edition) â Meta-analysis Summary â 26% (synthesis of 439 studies) â Large-sample CES-D Study 39.93% positive â PHQ-9 Positive (last 2 weeks) â 19.2% (CDC NHANES 2021â2023) Self-reported sadness/hopelessness in school â 42% (CDC YRBS 2021) Looking only at this data, it’s easy to conclude that depression among Chinese adolescents is severe. However, depressive symptoms are heavily influenced by screening thresholds and cultural expression, so they can’t be the sole standard.\n03 Suicide Rates: The Most Objective Mental Health Indicator To eliminate cultural and measurement biases, I looked up adolescent suicide rates. The results were very clear:\nCountry Age Group Year Suicide Rate (per 100,000) Source China 10â19 years 2021 2.83 JAMA Pediatrics 2023 United States 10â24 years 2021 11.0 CDC NCHS Data Brief 471 The adolescent suicide rate in the US is 3-4 times that of China. Even accounting for differences in statistical scope, the US rate is still significantly higher.\n04 The AI Admits Its “Mistake” When I presented this data to the AI, it frankly admitted:\n“My previous conclusion was based more on assumptions from my training data and general public opinionâthat ‘high stress = poor mental health’ârather than reasoning from hard data.”\nIt also stated that in the future, it would base its reasoning on objective data to avoid preconceived judgments and be truly scientific, objective, and fair.\nThis conversation left a deep impression on me: many parents, teachers, and even experts often rely on intuition rather than evidence when discussing “mental health.” The facts and public opinion can be two different things.\n05 The Rebound During the Pandemic It’s worth noting that after hitting a low of 1.59 per 100,000 in 2017, China’s adolescent suicide rate rebounded to 2.83 per 100,000 in 2021.\nThis period coincided with the online learning phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many children were at home for online classes, lacking a classroom atmosphere, losing motivation to study, becoming addicted to online games and short videos, having their routines disrupted, and even experiencing increased conflict with family. Their mental state fluctuated.\nFrom this perspective, this rebound precisely illustrates thatâ\nFocused study and a regular lifestyle are important protective factors for adolescent mental health.\nWhen the rhythm of learning was disrupted and children were just “going through the motions” by playing games on their computers, their mental health actually worsened.\n06 Stress Might Be Training for Psychological Resilience The data tells us something unexpected:\nAcademic pressure does not necessarily lead to mental collapse; on the contrary, it may cultivate a child’s resilience.\nChinese children have to deal with exams, rankings, and comparisons from a young age, which teaches them emotional regulation and how to cope with setbacks earlier. In contrast, an overly relaxed environment may not help children deal with real-world pressures, potentially making them more fragile when they encounter genuine difficulties.\n07 Takeaways for Parents Don’t panic about pressure: Moderate academic stress can cultivate a sense of purpose and resilience. Mental health isn’t just about “having fun”: A regular routine, engagement in learning, and family support are more crucial. Studying abroad is not a panacea: Adolescent suicide rates are higher in the West. Don’t see studying abroad as the only solution to mental health problems. 08 Conclusion Judging by the hard metric of suicide rates, the mental health of Chinese adolescents is no worse than that of their American counterparts, and may even be better.\nThe rebound during the pandemic also reminds us:\nMaintaining a regular study routine and focus is an important safeguard for mental health, not indulging in online games.\nAnd the AI in this discussion also gave us a reminder:\nDon’t blindly follow “public opinion and impressions.” Instead, use objective data to reason and arrive at more truthful conclusions.\n","wordCount":"863","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","dateModified":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.houdao.org/en/is-sending-kids-to-study-in-the-west-really-better-for-their-mental-health/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"zixia","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://www.houdao.org/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://www.houdao.org/en/ accesskey=h title="zixia (Alt + H)">zixia</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
