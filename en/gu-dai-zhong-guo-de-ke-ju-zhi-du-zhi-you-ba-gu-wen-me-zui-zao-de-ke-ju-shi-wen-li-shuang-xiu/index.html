For a long time, the true imperial examination system was a “balance of arts and sciences.” Ancient China was not just a land of poetry, books, rites, and music, but also a civilization that revered science and reason.\n📖 I. The Starting Point of the Imperial Exams: Giving Every Humble Scholar a Chance Emperor Yang of Sui initiated the imperial examination system, and the Tang Dynasty perfected it. This system broke the monopoly of aristocratic clans, allowing commoners to enter officialdom based on knowledge. It was the world’s earliest meritocratic system for talent.\nThe Tang Dynasty’s exams not only tested for “Jinshi” (Advanced Scholars) but also included STEM subjects like “Suanxue” (Mathematics) and “Mingsuan” (Computational Studies):\nGeometric measurement Hydraulic engineering design Architectural proportions Astronomy and calendrical science The monk Xuanzang and his companions could accurately predict solar eclipses—this was not a miracle, but science. The study of science and engineering was a key criterion for selecting officials at the time.\n📚 II. The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art: The Foundation of the Han Rational Tradition In the first century BCE, the Chinese had already written The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art. This book could solve systems of equations, measure slopes, and calculate embankments, making it the world’s earliest masterpiece of applied mathematics.\nOne problem from the book:\n“There are three types of grain, with different prices and weights. When sold together, they fetch a certain amount of money. What is the price of each type of grain?” This is the prototype of a system of three linear equations with three variables.\nAt that time, Europe was still using Roman numerals and had not yet developed the concept of “zero.” This book later became the core textbook for the “Mathematics” subject in the Sui and Tang imperial exams. It reflects the fundamental spirit of the Han people: “to believe in reason and to use techniques for practical purposes.”\n🧮 III. STEM Exam Questions: As Difficult as Modern Engineering The exam questions for “Mathematics Scholars” in the Song Dynasty were extremely difficult. For example:\n“If a canal is divided into three branches, each drawing a different amount of water, how high should the weirs be built to equalize the water flow?”\nThis already involves fluid dynamics and geometric calculations. At that time, “Doctors of Mathematics” and officials of the “Directorate for Waterways” were in charge of engineering and surveying. Passing this kind of “STEM examination” was equivalent to being a “national engineer” today.\nIn that era, being an official required not only writing poetry but also understanding architecture and algorithms. Reason, practicality, and science were part of the government system.\n⛪ IV. The Divergence of Reason and Faith: The Different Paths of the Han and Europe Meanwhile, Europe was mired in the “Dark Ages” under religious rule. The Church declared:\n“The Earth is the center of the universe, and to question this is heresy.”\nBruno was burned at the stake, Copernicus was imprisoned, and Galileo was forced to recant. Reason and science were burned to ashes by the fire of faith.\nChina, on the other hand, used the imperial examinations to stimulate reason and scholarship to replace faith. One used religion to control thought; the other used examinations to reward intellect. These two paths determined the trajectories of two civilizations.\n☪️ V. Backward Europe, Open Islam While medieval Europe was shackled by religion, the Islamic world was at a civilizational peak.\nThe “House of Wisdom” in Baghdad brought together scholars from Greece, Persia, and India, spurring leaps in algebra, astronomy, medicine, and chemistry. “Arabic numerals” and chemical terms with the “al-” prefix all originated from here.\nAt that time, Muslim women were not forced to cover their heads, while the Christian world required women to veil their faces and forbade them from learning. At that time, Islam was more open, and Christianity was more conservative.\nThe key to civilization is not the name of the religion, but whether it respects reason.\n🎨 VI. The Renaissance: The Rebirth of Reason, Europe’s Comeback In the 16th century, Luther’s Reformation tore apart the shackles of theocracy. The liberation of thought brought about the Renaissance and the Scientific Revolution.\nDa Vinci, Copernicus, Galileo, Newton… Humanity moved from geocentrism to understanding the cosmos, from alchemy to chemistry, from faith to science. The Renaissance paved the way for Europe’s future technological leadership.\n⚙️ VII. China’s Decline: The Interruption of the STEM Tradition The turmoil of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period destroyed the education system; Although the Song Dynasty retained the mathematics subject, its status declined; The Yuan Dynasty abolished STEM examinations for the Han Chinese, The Ming Dynasty replaced practical studies with the eight-legged essay—reason became shackled by literary formalism. From then on, China’s technology ceased to develop systematically. Craftsmanship remained at the level of “technique” (术, shu) but lost its “way” (道, dao). While Europe sailed towards the Age of Discovery and the Industrial Revolution, we stalled on the eve of our own “Tiangong Kaiwu” (The Exploitation of the Works of Nature).\n☯️ VIII. The Foundation of Han Belief: Respecting Spirits but Keeping Them at a Distance To understand why China embarked on the path of reason and science so early, we must return to the source of its thought—the belief structure of the Han people.\nKing Wen of Zhou forbade the “disorderly worship of ghosts and spirits.” Confucius went further, saying, “Respect ghosts and spirits, but keep them at a distance.” This is not just a ritualistic doctrine, but a declaration of spiritual independence.\nThe Han people worship their ancestors, not superstitious deities; Yuchi Jingde became a door god, Guan Yu the God of War, and Mazu the protector of seafarers— They are all “moralized” and “personified” deities, not religious creations.\nThis cultural DNA proves: The Han people are naturally endowed with the brilliance of reason, unbound by religious dogma. They believe in patterns, value practice, and are better suited than any other people to follow the path of science.\nThis is why China could produce The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art in the BCE era, establish STEM examinations in the Sui and Tang dynasties, and invent gunpowder, the compass, the waterwheel, and printing in the Song Dynasty. Reason has always been the hidden source code of Han civilization.\n🕯️ IX. Conclusion: Reason is a Nation’s True Faith From King Wen of Zhou’s rational rituals to the STEM examinations of the Sui and Tang; From the scientific spirit of The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art to the belief of “respecting spirits but keeping them at a distance”; The fundamental color of Han civilization has always been reason.\nUnfortunately, this flame was once obscured by the shadows of war and power. But reason was never extinguished— It still flickers in every heart that seeks truth and questions.\nTrue faith is not gazing at the heavens, but planting one’s feet firmly on the ground.\nWhen we pick up the torch of reason and science once again, perhaps, we can once again become guides for human civilization.\n","wordCount":"1243","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","dateModified":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"/en/gu-dai-zhong-guo-de-ke-ju-zhi-du-zhi-you-ba-gu-wen-me-zui-zao-de-ke-ju-shi-wen-li-shuang-xiu/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"zixia","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=/en/ accesskey=h title="zixia (Alt + H)">zixia</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
