For a very long time, the authentic imperial examination system required a dual focus on both humanities and sciences. Ancient China was not only a land of poetry, books, rites, and music but also a civilization that revered science and reason.\n📖 1. The Starting Point: Giving Every Humble Scholar a Chance Emperor Yang of the Sui Dynasty initiated the imperial examination system, which was perfected during the Tang Dynasty. This system broke the monopoly of aristocratic clans, allowing commoners to enter officialdom through knowledge. It was the world’s earliest system of “meritocratic equality.”\nThe Tang Dynasty’s imperial examinations not only tested for the “Jinshi” (the highest degree), but also included science and engineering subjects like “Mathematics” and “Calculation”:\nGeometric measurement Hydraulic engineering design Architectural proportions Astronomy and calendrical science The ability of Tang Sanzang and his companions to accurately predict a solar eclipse was not a miracle—it was science. The study of science and engineering was a key criterion for selecting talent by the government of that era.\n📚 2. The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art: The Bedrock of Han Rational Tradition By the first century BCE, the Chinese had already written The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art. This book could solve systems of equations, measure slopes, and calculate dike constructions, making it the world’s earliest masterpiece of applied mathematics.\nOne problem from the book asks:\n“There are three types of grain, with different prices and weights. When mixed and sold, a certain amount of money is obtained. What is the price of each type of grain?” This is the prototype of a system of three linear equations.\nAt that time, Europe was still using Roman numerals and had not even developed the concept of “zero.” This book later became the core textbook for the “Mathematics” subject in the Sui and Tang examinations, reflecting the foundational spirit of the Han people: “taking reason as belief and technique as application.”\n🧮 3. Science and Engineering Exam Questions: As Difficult as Modern Engineering The examination questions for the “Mathematics Juren” (provincial mathematics graduates) in the Song Dynasty were extremely difficult. For example:\n“If a canal is divided into three branches, each drawing a different amount of water, how high should the weir be built to equalize the water flow?”\nThis already involves fluid dynamics and geometric calculations. Officials like the “Doctor of Mathematics” and those in the “Directorate for Waterways” were in charge of engineering and surveying. Passing this kind of “science and engineering examination” was equivalent to becoming a “state engineer” today.\nIn that era, being an official required not only writing poetry but also understanding architecture and algorithms. Reason, practicality, and science were part of the governmental system.\n⛪ 4. The Divergence of Reason and Faith: The Different Paths of the Han Chinese and Europe Meanwhile, Europe was mired in the “Dark Ages” under religious rule. The Church declared:\n“The Earth is the center of the universe. To question this is heresy.”\nGiordano Bruno was burned at the stake, Copernicus was imprisoned, and Galileo was forced to recant. Reason and science were reduced to ashes by the fires of faith.\nChina, on the other hand, used the “imperial examinations” to stimulate reason and “scholarship” to replace faith. One used religion to control thought; the other used examinations to reward intellect. These two paths determined the trajectories of two different civilizations.\n☪️ 5. A Backward Europe, An Open Islamic World While medieval Europe was shackled by religion, the Islamic world was at the peak of its civilization.\nBaghdad’s “House of Wisdom” gathered scholars from Greece, Persia, and India, catalyzing leaps in algebra, astronomy, medicine, and chemistry. “Arabic numerals” and chemical terms with the prefix “al-” all originated from this period.\nAt that time, Muslim women were not required to cover their heads, whereas the Christian world demanded women to veil their faces and forbade them from learning. The Islam of that era was more open, and the Christianity of that era was more conservative.\nThe key to civilization lies not in the name of a religion, but in whether it respects reason.\n🎨 6. The Renaissance: The Rebirth of Reason, Europe’s Comeback In the 16th century, Martin Luther’s Reformation shattered the shackles of theocracy. The liberation of thought brought about the Renaissance and the Scientific Revolution.\nDa Vinci, Copernicus, Galileo, Newton… Mankind progressed from a geocentric model to understanding the cosmos, from alchemy to chemistry, from faith to science. The Renaissance paved the way for Europe’s future technological leadership.\n⚙️ 7. China’s Decline: The Interruption of the Science and Engineering Tradition The turmoil of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period destroyed the education system. Although the Song Dynasty retained the mathematics subject, its status declined. The Yuan Dynasty abolished science and engineering examinations for the Han Chinese. The Ming Dynasty replaced practical studies with the eight-legged essay—reason was shackled by literary formalism. From then on, China’s technology ceased to develop systematically. Craftsmanship remained at the level of “technique” (术) but lost its connection to the underlying principles or “Way” (道). As Europe sailed towards the Age of Discovery and the Industrial Revolution, we stalled on the eve of our own Tiangong Kaiwu (The Exploitation of the Works of Nature).\n☯️ 8. The Foundation of Han Belief: “Respect Ghosts and Gods, but Keep Them at a Distance” (Connecting the previous points: Why the Han people are naturally endowed with a rational gene)\nTo understand why China was able to embark on the path of reason and science so early, we must return to the source of its thought—the belief structure of the Han people.\nKing Wen of Zhou forbade the “chaotic worship of ghosts and spirits.” Confucius went further, saying, “Respect ghosts and gods, but keep them at a distance.” This was not just a principle of ritual propriety but a declaration of spiritual independence.\nThe Han people worship ancestors, not deities in a superstitious way. Yuchi Jingde became a door god, Guan Yu became the God of War, and Mazu protects seafarers— they are all “moralized” and “personified” gods, not religious creations.\nThis cultural DNA proves that: The Han people are naturally endowed with the brilliance of reason, unconstrained by religious dogma. They believe in patterns, value practice, and are better suited than any other people to follow the path of science.\nIt is for this reason that China could produce The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art in the BCE era, establish science and engineering examinations in the Sui and Tang dynasties, and invent gunpowder, the compass, the waterwheel, and printing in the Song Dynasty. Reason has always been the hidden source code of Han civilization.\n🕯️ 9. Conclusion: Reason is the True Faith of a People From King Wen of Zhou’s rational rituals to the Sui and Tang’s science and engineering examinations; From the scientific spirit of The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art to the belief of “respecting ghosts and gods but keeping them at a distance”; The underlying color of Han civilization has always been reason.\nUnfortunately, this flame was once obscured by the shadows of war and power. But reason was never extinguished— it still flickers in every heart that seeks truth and dares to question.\nTrue faith is not about looking up at the heavens, but about having your feet firmly on the ground.\nWhen we once again pick up the torch of reason and science, perhaps we can, once more, become the guides of human civilization.\nan encyclopedia of craftsmanship\n","wordCount":"1321","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","dateModified":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"/en/beyond-the-eight-legged-essay-the-scientific-roots-of-china-s-imperial-exams/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"zixia","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=/en/ accesskey=h title="zixia (Alt + H)">zixia</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
