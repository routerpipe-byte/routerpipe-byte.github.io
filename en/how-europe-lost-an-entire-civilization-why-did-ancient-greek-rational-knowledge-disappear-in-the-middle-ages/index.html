The civilization that truly preserved, translated, studied, and further developed it was, in fact, the Islamic world.\nThis is not a value judgment, but a historical outcome formed by a series of fractures in language → institutions → religion → politics.\nI. Ancient Greece: The Starting Point of Rational Civilization (c. 6th–3rd centuries BCE)\nStarting in the 6th century BCE, ancient Greece achieved the first true rational leap in human history:\nMathematics was organized into an axiomatic system: Elements (Euclid) Philosophy was structured through logical argumentation (Plato, Aristotle) Natural phenomena began to be explained without mythology But this entire civilization rested on an extremely fragile premise:\nIt was highly dependent on language, educational systems, and manuscript transmission.\nII. Plato and Aristotle Not Just ‘Ideas,’ but a Complete System of Original Works Ancient Greek philosophy was not a collection of “viewpoints” pieced together by later generations, but a systematic body of knowledge constituted by original works.\nPlato (c. 427–347 BCE)\nHe conducted philosophical training in the form of dialogues:\nRepublic: Justice, the state, the philosopher-king Symposium: How love ascends from the sensory to the ideal Phaedo: The immortality of the soul Theaetetus: What is “knowledge” His core concept was the Theory of Forms: the rational world is superior to the sensory world.\nAristotle (384–322 BCE)\nHe was the first person in human history to systematically organize all branches of knowledge:\nLogic: Organon Metaphysics: Metaphysics Natural Science: Physics, On the Soul Biology: History of Animals Politics and Ethics: Nicomachean Ethics, Politics 📌 He laid the foundation for logical reasoning, classification methods, and empirical observation.\nIII. A Decisive Prerequisite —All of This Was Written in Greek These works were all written in the highly abstract Greek language, relying on an academic educational system and a tradition of manuscript copying.\nOnce the language was broken and the institutions collapsed, this knowledge would not ‘slowly decline’ but crash directly.\nIV. Rome Inherited from Greece but Failed to Disseminate the Knowledge (From 146 BCE onward)\nAfter Rome conquered Greece, a clear social stratification emerged:\nUpper elite: Spoke Greek, studied Greek philosophy Common people and the military: Spoke Latin 📌 The language of knowledge and the language of society diverged.\nRome inherited the achievements but failed to establish a universal system for education and knowledge transmission.\nV. Christianity as the State Religion —The Shift in the Legitimacy of Knowledge (380 CE) In 380 CE, the Roman Empire established Christianity as the state religion.\nFrom then on:\nSource of truth → The Bible Right of interpretation → The Church Classical philosophy and natural studies → Pagan heritage Reason did not disappear immediately, but it began to gradually lose institutional protection.\nVI. After the Fall of the Western Roman Empire Did Europeans Really ‘Bathe Only Three Times in Their Lives’? In 476 CE, the Germanic chieftain Odoacer deposed the Western Roman Emperor Romulus Augustulus.\nAfter the fall of the Western Roman Empire, it wasn’t just philosophy and science that were fractured, but daily civilization itself.\nOne of the most direct and easily understood examples is bathing.\nIn the Roman period:\nPublic baths were ubiquitous in cities Hot and cold water systems, underfloor heating, and sewers were common Bathing was for both hygiene and socializing In medieval Western Europe:\nCities declined, and public baths largely disappeared The Church grew wary of “nudity and pleasure” The idea that “bathing makes you sick” became prevalent This led to the popular saying we hear today:\n“Medieval Europeans only bathed three times in their lives: at birth, marriage, and death.”\nThis is not a complete fabrication—the ideas of “bathing as little as possible” and “not bathing is healthier” were indeed treated as a serious lifestyle philosophy in late medieval Western Europe.\nWhen institutions and urban civilization collapse, humanity may even voluntarily abandon technologies it has already mastered.\nVII. Civilizational Divergence Greek Civilization Survived in the Eastern Roman Empire Meanwhile, in the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire:\nThe official and ecclesiastical language remained Greek The original works of Plato and Aristotle were systematically preserved Continuity was maintained in cities, education, and administration However, after the East-West Schism in 1054, knowledge was completely isolated by religious and political boundaries.\nVIII. How the Islamic World Received Greek Civilization (8th–10th centuries)\nContrary to modern stereotypes, the Islamic world of the 8th–10th centuries was one of the most rational, prosperous, and cosmopolitan civilizations of its time.\nAfter the establishment of the Abbasid Caliphate (750 CE):\nThe “House of Wisdom” was established in Baghdad in the 9th century Greek philosophy, mathematics, and medicine were systematically translated Plato, Aristotle, and Euclid were fully translated and introduced More importantly:\nThey not only translated but also studied, collated, and further developed these works.\nWhen medieval Europeans first truly encountered Byzantine and Islamic cities, they did not see a “pagan wasteland” but rather:\nRunning water systems and public baths Hospitals, pharmacies, and university-like institutions Prosperous urban life and international trade networks 📌 This is not a later fabrication of praise but the genuine shock repeatedly documented in Crusader chronicles.\nIX. Jerusalem: Different Attitudes Towards Non-believers This civilizational difference was particularly evident in Jerusalem.\nIn 1099, the Crusaders captured Jerusalem:\nA large-scale massacre of the city’s inhabitants Civilians were indiscriminately slaughtered Jerusalem under Muslim rule:\nNon-believers were allowed to keep their faith They were free to choose to stay or leave They only needed to pay a poll tax to live there This is not a moral judgment but an institutional fact:\nOnly a society that allows for the coexistence of multiple faiths has the space to preserve ‘pagan’ knowledge.\nX. Multiple Paths Greek Civilization’s ‘Detour Home’ Greek knowledge did not suddenly “revive” in Europe one day; it underwent a long and tortuous civilizational transfer.\nThree key paths:\nThe Fourth Crusade (1204) Instead of heading to Muslim territories, the Crusaders sacked Constantinople, bringing a large number of Greek manuscripts back to Western Europe. The Arabic-to-Latin Translation Movement on the Iberian Peninsula European scholars actively traveled to Muslim-ruled regions to study, re-engaging with classical works by Aristotle, Euclid, and others through Arabic translations. The Westward Migration of Scholars After the Fall of Constantinople in 1453 Byzantine scholars fled to Italy with original Greek texts, directly fueling the humanistic and academic revival of the early Renaissance. In this path of return, the transmission sequence of Greek civilization is clear:\nGreek → Arabic → Latin → Europe\nThis was not a simple revival, but a cross-civilizational, cross-linguistic, and cross-religious return of knowledge.\nXI. A Decisive Rebuttal to Theories of Falsified Ancient History In recent years, a theory has become popular:\n“Ancient Greek civilization was fabricated after the Renaissance.”\nBut this claim is untenable both logically and evidentially:\nOriginal Greek works were preserved in the Byzantine Empire. They were independently translated by the rival civilization of the Arab world. They were then translated back from Arabic into Latin. 📌 This represents cross-verification across multiple civilizations, languages, and religions.\nIf it were a forgery, one would have to assume that:\nChristian civilization Islamic civilization Byzantine civilization collaborated on a forgery for centuries while being long-term adversaries—something historically impossible.\nXII. The Reformation Reason Finally Regains Legitimacy Even after this knowledge returned to Europe, it was not initially “safe.”\nIt wasn’t until after the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century that Europe’s intellectual environment fundamentally changed.\nWith the spread of Martin Luther’s Reformation:\nThe absolute authority of the Pope was weakened Individual reading and interpretation were acknowledged Scholarship gradually broke free from direct theological censorship Ancient Greek reason was finally no longer a ‘dangerous pagan heritage’ but once again a knowledge system that was permitted, studied, and developed.\nXIII. How Greek Civilization Ignited the Renaissance (15th–17th centuries)\nWhen this knowledge re-entered Europe, it directly stimulated the birth of a generation of geniuses.\nLeonardo da Vinci: Anatomy, proportion, perspective Galileo: Described nature using mathematics, a direct inheritance of the ancient Greek scientific spirit 📌 They did not appear out of thin air; they were standing on the shoulders of the ancient Greeks once more.\nConclusion Civilizations Do Not Vanish or Appear from Nothing The knowledge of ancient Greece and Rome:\nWas not forged Nor did it naturally die out It was simply impacted by:\nLinguistic fracture Institutional collapse Religious monopoly Political isolation When the conditions were restored, reason naturally returned.\nHistory is not a matter of emotion, but a matter of evidence.\n","wordCount":"1493","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","dateModified":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"/en/how-europe-lost-an-entire-civilization-why-did-ancient-greek-rational-knowledge-disappear-in-the-middle-ages/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"zixia","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=/en/ accesskey=h title="zixia (Alt + H)">zixia</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
