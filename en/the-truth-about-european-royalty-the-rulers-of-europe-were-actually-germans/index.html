French royal family is French,\nand the Spanish royal family is, naturally, Spanish.\nBut if you take even a brief look at the history of European royalty, you’ll discover a fact that is both absurd and very true—\nThe core of the entire European royal system is almost entirely made up of Germans.\nNot just a few, but in a systemic way.\nMany people will ask:\nWhy the Germans?\nThe answer is actually very pragmatic.\nAfter the Fall of Rome, They Were the Only Ones Left Who Could Truly Fight After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Europe didn’t immediately usher in a “new civilization.” Instead, it entered a long period of chaos:\nThe administrative system collapsed The tax system disintegrated Cities declined Armies were no longer organized units The world that had once run on the Roman system was suddenly empty.\nAnd it was at this moment that the various Germanic tribes stepped forward.\nThey weren’t sophisticated or romantic, but they had several crucial advantages:\nStrong organizational skills Highly militarized They could fight, and they could also govern To put it bluntly:\nWhile others were still reminiscing about Rome, they had already begun to take control of reality.\nSo It Wasn’t That They “Proclaimed” Themselves Rulers, but That Others Invited Them This is a frequently misunderstood point.\nIt wasn’t the Germans who ran out and said, “We are the heirs of Rome.”\nRather, the Church and local elites of the time discovered—\nWithout them, order simply couldn’t be maintained.\nThus, a very pragmatic model of cooperation emerged:\nThe Church provided “legitimacy” (You are approved by God) Germanic warriors provided “force” and order This was the underlying logic of the later so-called “Holy Roman Empire.”\nIt wasn’t a cultural inheritance, but an exchange of power.\nThen Things Started to Get Interesting Because the German-speaking regions were long in a state of:\nNo unified state Numerous principalities Every house could fight Every house had a “legitimate bloodline” What did this mean?\nIt meant this region became Europe’s—\nRoyal Reserve.\nA dynasty ended in some country?\nGo find a replacement in Germany.\nA country’s situation is unstable?\nFind a German noble to stabilize it.\nOver time, almost all of Europe’s royal families were “contracted out” by this system.\nBritain Is the Most Typical Example Many people think the British royal family is very “native,” but it’s quite the opposite.\nUntil before World War I, the official family name of the British royal family was: Saxe-Coburg-Gotha\nStandard German.\nIt was only because anti-German sentiment was so strong during WWI that they were forced to change it to the very “British” sounding name we know today—Windsor.\nAnd you should know one thing:\nThe mother tongue of the early British kings was not English.\nThey were more accustomed to communicating in German in their daily lives;\nEnglish was more the “language of their subjects.”\nHence the widely circulated phrase—\n“The King of England can’t speak English.”\nOther Countries Were the Same 🇪🇸 Spain The House of Bourbon came from France, and the French royal system itself was deeply influenced by the German aristocratic structure.\n🇧🇪 Belgium The royal family comes directly from a German noble family.\n🇳🇱 Netherlands The ruling family also belongs to the German aristocratic system.\n🇮🇹 Italy The royal family after unification came from a noble family in the Alpine region, which was itself part of a German-Italian mixed system.\nNo matter how you look at it, it all leads back to the circle of German nobility.\nThis is not a coincidence, but a structural result.\nHere’s the Truly Ironic Part Later, when Europe entered the era of nation-states,\npeople began to talk about “national identity” and “state identity.”\nBut before that—\nthe royal families who ruled these countries,\nwere precisely the group of people who cared least about nationality.\nThey recognized only bloodlines, not national borders;\nfor them, a country was just a “place of work.”\nEuropean royalty were not symbols of their nations;\nthey were one of the first small groups of people in the Middle Ages to become “internationalized.”\n","wordCount":"692","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","dateModified":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"/en/the-truth-about-european-royalty-the-rulers-of-europe-were-actually-germans/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"zixia","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body
