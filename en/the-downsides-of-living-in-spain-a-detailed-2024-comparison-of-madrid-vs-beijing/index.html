Mobile Network Quality and Cost Comparison Network Coverage and Signal Strength: According to data from institutions like Speedtest Intelligence and OpenSignal, Beijing outperforms Madrid in both the prevalence and stability of 5G and 4G networks. Beijing’s 5G coverage exceeds 95%, whereas Madrid still has signal dead zones in some urban areas and even indoors. Price for a 30GB Data Plan: Madrid: The average monthly fee is around €25–30 (¥200–240), with legacy carriers like Movistar and Vodafone being even more expensive. Beijing: The average monthly price for a 30GB data + calls plan from China Mobile/Unicom/Telecom is around ¥60–80. Mobile communication costs in Spain are about 3 times higher than in China, and network coverage and signal stability are also comparatively worse.\nConclusion From the comparison of the 18 specific life metrics above, it is clear that Spain (especially Madrid) lags behind Beijing in almost every aspect, including consumer costs, public service efficiency, educational quality, transportation convenience, and daily maintenance services. Although Spain boasts a beautiful natural environment and a slower pace of life, its high cost of living and inefficient allocation of public resources cannot be ignored.\nIt is particularly noteworthy that in higher education admissions, universities in Europe and America, including Spain, widely practice a “diversity admissions” system. Admission criteria are not solely based on grades but also heavily consider the applicant’s race and ethnicity. East Asians (of Chinese descent), due to their generally excellent exam scores, are paradoxically classified as a “non-disadvantaged group” and are placed under stricter scrutiny in the competition.\nData shows:\nThe average IB score for many international schools in Beijing is between 35–38. Most schools in Madrid only average around 31–34. Although students of Chinese descent achieve excellent results, in internationally standardized tests like the IB and A-Levels, which have a global unified exam and grading system, the admission standards are identical for everyone. In this context, applying to university from China is more advantageous than applying locally from Spain, because Chinese students as a whole have higher scores and are more competitive. It must be specified that even students of Chinese descent who have obtained Spanish citizenship are still considered “East Asian” in the diversity admissions system. Therefore, they are held to the same standard as applicants from China, with scores ultimately being the key deciding factor.\nIn summary, Chinese families planning to immigrate, study, or make long-term investments in Spain need to conduct a comprehensive and rational assessment of its high living costs, slow-paced administrative system, and the underlying inequalities in its education and employment policies.\nAppendix: Madrid vs. Beijing Key Life Metrics Comparison Table (2024) Comparison Item Madrid Beijing Coca-Cola (500ml) €1.50 ≈ ¥12.3 ¥3 Big Mac €5.65 ≈ ¥43 ¥25.5 95-Octane Gasoline (per liter) €1.57 ≈ ¥12 ¥7.9 Water Fee (per m³) €1.0–2.63 (¥7.6–20) ¥7.9 Electricity Fee (per kWh) €0.14 ≈ ¥1.2 ¥0.49 Natural Gas (per kWh) €0.091 ≈ ¥0.7 ¥0.26 Teacher Absenteeism Rate Up to 20% Extremely low Average IB Score Approx. 33 Approx. 36 Four-Star Hotel ¥2,172 ¥569 AC Installation Fee ¥2,500 ¥80–200 (often free) Total AC Unit Price ¥6,800 ¥2,500–3,200 High-Speed Rail Speed 200 km/h Approx. 300 km/h High-Speed Rail Fare (per km) ¥1.2–2.4 ¥0.46–0.48 Hospital Wait for Specialist Average 95 days Usually 1–7 days Volkswagen Golf 1.4L Price ¥243,000 ¥152,263 2-BR Rent (City Center) ¥9,200–15,300 ¥4,000–8,000 Single Subway Fare ¥11–15 ¥3 Kitchen Drain Unclogging ¥1,200–4,000 (Emergency ¥10,800) ¥80–200 (Emergency under ¥300) 30GB Mobile Plan ¥200–240 ¥60–80 5G Signal Coverage Weak/spotty in some areas Nearly full city coverage ","wordCount":"1235","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","dateModified":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"/en/the-downsides-of-living-in-spain-a-detailed-2024-comparison-of-madrid-vs-beijing/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"zixia","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=/en/ accesskey=h title="zixia (Alt + H)">zixia</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">

Although Spain boasts a beautiful natural environment and a slower pace of life, its high cost of living and inefficient allocation of public resources cannot be ignored.</p><p>It is particularly noteworthy that in higher education admissions, universities in Europe and America, including Spain, widely practice a &ldquo;diversity admissions&rdquo; system. Admission criteria are not solely based on grades but also heavily consider the applicant&rsquo;s race and ethnicity. East Asians (of Chinese descent), due to their generally excellent exam scores, are paradoxically classified as a &ldquo;non-disadvantaged group&rdquo; and are placed under stricter scrutiny in the competition.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Data shows:</strong></p><ul><li>The average IB score for many international schools in Beijing is between 35–38.</li><li>Most schools in Madrid only average around 31–34.</li></ul></blockquote><blockquote><p>Although students of Chinese descent achieve excellent results, in internationally standardized tests like the IB and A-Levels, which have a global unified exam and grading system, the admission standards are identical for everyone. In this context, applying to university from China is more advantageous than applying locally from Spain, because Chinese students as a whole have higher scores and are more competitive. It must be specified that even students of Chinese descent who have obtained Spanish citizenship are still considered &ldquo;East Asian&rdquo; in the diversity admissions system. Therefore, they are held to the same standard as applicants from China, with scores ultimately being the key deciding factor.</p></blockquote><p>In summary, Chinese families planning to immigrate, study, or make long-term investments in Spain need to conduct a comprehensive and rational assessment of its high living costs, slow-paced administrative system, and the underlying inequalities in its education and employment policies.</p><hr><h2 id=appendix-madrid-vs-beijing-key-life-metrics-comparison-table-2024><strong>Appendix: Madrid vs. Beijing Key Life Metrics Comparison Table (2024)</strong><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#appendix-madrid-vs-beijing-key-life-metrics-comparison-table-2024>#</a></h2><table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:left>Comparison Item</th><th style=text-align:left>Madrid</th><th style=text-align:left>Beijing</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:left><strong>Coca-Cola (500ml)</strong></td><td style=text-align:left>€1.50 ≈ ¥12.3</td><td style=text-align:left>¥3</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left><strong>Big Mac</strong></td><td style=text-align:left>€5.65 ≈ ¥43</td><td style=text-align:left>¥25.5</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left><strong>95-Octane Gasoline (per liter)</strong></td><td style=text-align:left>€1.57 ≈ ¥12</td><td style=text-align:left>¥7.9</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left><strong>Water Fee (per m³)</strong></td><td style=text-align:left>€1.0–2.63 (¥7.6–20)</td><td style=text-align:left>¥7.9</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left><strong>Electricity Fee (per kWh)</strong></td><td style=text-align:left>€0.14 ≈ ¥1.2</td><td style=text-align:left>¥0.49</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left><strong>Natural Gas (per kWh)</strong></td><td style=text-align:left>€0.091 ≈ ¥0.7</td><td style=text-align:left>¥0.26</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left><strong>Teacher Absenteeism Rate</strong></td><td style=text-align:left>Up to 20%</td><td style=text-align:left>Extremely low</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left><strong>Average IB Score</strong></td><td style=text-align:left>Approx. 33</td><td style=text-align:left>Approx. 36</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left><strong>Four-Star Hotel</strong></td><td style=text-align:left>¥2,172</td><td style=text-align:left>¥569</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left><strong>AC Installation Fee</strong></td><td style=text-align:left>¥2,500</td><td style=text-align:left>¥80–200 (often free)</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left><strong>Total AC Unit Price</strong></td><td style=text-align:left>¥6,800</td><td style=text-align:left>¥2,500–3,200</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left><strong>High-Speed Rail Speed</strong></td><td style=text-align:left>200 km/h</td><td style=text-align:left>Approx. 300 km/h</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left><strong>High-Speed Rail Fare (per km)</strong></td><td style=text-align:left>¥1.2–2.4</td><td style=text-align:left>¥0.46–0.48</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left><strong>Hospital Wait for Specialist</strong></td><td style=text-align:left>Average 95 days</td><td style=text-align:left>Usually 1–7 days</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left><strong>Volkswagen Golf 1.4L Price</strong></td><td style=text-align:left>¥243,000</td><td style=text-align:left>¥152,263</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left><strong>2-BR Rent (City Center)</strong></td><td style=text-align:left>¥9,200–15,300</td><td style=text-align:left>¥4,000–8,000</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left><strong>Single Subway Fare</strong></td><td style=text-align:left>¥11–15</td><td style=text-align:left>¥3</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left><strong>Kitchen Drain Unclogging</strong></td><td style=text-align:left>¥1,200–4,000 (Emergency ¥10,800)</td><td style=text-align:left>¥80–200 (Emergency under ¥300)</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left><strong>30GB Mobile Plan</strong></td><td style=text-align:left>¥200–240</td><td style=text-align:left>¥60–80</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left><strong>5G Signal Coverage</strong></td><td style=text-align:left>Weak/spotty in some areas</td><td style=text-align:left>Nearly full city coverage</td></tr></tbody></table></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul></footer><div class=comments><script src=https://giscus.app/client.js data-repo=routerpipe-byte/routerpipe-byte.github.io data-repo-id=R_kgDORGxuaA data-category="zixia Comments" data-category-id=DIC_kwDORGxuaM4C15FB data-mapping=pathname data-strict=0 data-reactions-enabled=1 data-emit-metadata=0 data-input-position=bottom data-theme=preferred_color_scheme data-lang=en crossorigin=anonymous async></script></div></article></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2026 <a href=/en/>zixia</a></span> ·
