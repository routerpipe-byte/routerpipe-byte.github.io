This journey offered a mix of cities, ancient castles, mountains, the sea, and delicious food. We were a group of four.

Day 2 | Zaragoza → Olite Accommodation: Hotel Alda Castillo de Olite ¥1117.47 (1 night, 1 double bed + 2 single beds, no breakfast) Sightseeing: Royal Palace of Olite (Palacio Real de Olite), considered one of the most luxurious castles of the Middle Ages. Built in the 13th-14th centuries, it has over 300 rooms, Moorish-style courtyards, and notably, an ice well for storing food. It’s great for in-depth tours and photography. Day 3 | Olite → Bilbao Accommodation: NH Collection Villa de Bilbao ¥2200 (2 standard rooms, no meals) Booked for 12:30: Visit to the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao (Guggenheim Bilbao Museoa, ticket €13, closed on Mondays, recommend at least 2 hours) Sightseeing: Walk along the Nervión River to enjoy the city scenery. The flower dog sculpture (Puppy) and the 9-meter-tall giant spider sculpture at the entrance of the Guggenheim Museum are must-see landmarks. Zubizuri Bridge, beautiful at night, with a flower market on weekends. The train station by the river also has a nice night view. Chávarri Palace (Txabarri Jauregia), a yellow-green palace near the museum with distinctive architecture. Arriaga Theatre, elegant in style. Boat tour (City Hall—Deusto Canal—Portugalete Bridge—Getxo—Santurtzi fishing port), a fun way to see the sights. Vizcaya Bridge (Bizkaiko Zubia), a World Heritage site. A red iron bridge, the cable car ride is only €1. Food: Café Iruña, an old establishment from 1903, part bar and part restaurant. The grilled lamb skewers and various tapas are very popular. Reservations are needed for main meals, but tapas can be ordered anytime. The retro decor is very photogenic. Mio Basque Urban Food, rated 4.7. Recommended dishes include the onsen egg with mushrooms and foie gras, steak, and cheesecake with a scoop of blueberry ice cream. Basque Cheesecake, a local specialty, available in two flavors: strong (fuerte) and mild (suave). Cantoki Jatetxea, rated 4.9, at Cruces station on Line 2. Unfortunately, we couldn’t get a reservation. Goizeko Izarra steakhouse and La Casita de Sabino fish restaurant were closed on Sunday, so we couldn’t try them. We passed by Dragonstone (Gaztelugatxe), but unfortunately, tickets were sold out. I set an alarm for 14:55 to try and grab any remaining same-day tickets (Ticket website: https://www.tiketa.eus/gaztelugatxe/).\nDay 4 | Bilbao → Santander Accommodation: Silken Rio Santander Hotel ¥2800 (2 rooms, breakfast included) Booked for 10:30: Visit to the Magdalena Palace (Palacio de la Magdalena), exiting at 11:15. Tickets are €6. Open on Sundays from 10:45-13:00. Recommend allowing 1-2 hours. The palace is located on a headland in a royal park with stunning scenery. Attractions: Centro Botín: Drove past for a look without stopping. It has a modern exterior. Maritime Museum (Museo Marítimo), tickets €8, open 10:00–18:00 on Sundays. Worth a visit if you’re interested in maritime culture. Parque Marino de la Magdalena beach park, has sea lions, great for photos. Cabárceno Nature Park (Entrada este), suitable for families. Restaurants: Taberna La Radio, a 20-year-old local seafood restaurant. The ambiance is average, but the seafood is excellent. Five-star value for money. Restaurante La Gruta de Jose (The Cave Restaurant), near the pier and Centro Botín, rated 4.7. Unfortunately, we couldn’t get a reservation. Comillas: El Capricho de Gaudí, tickets €7, open 10:30-19:30 on Sundays. This building is a masterpiece from when Gaudí was 30. The owner was a wealthy, artistic bachelor. The garden’s hydrangeas are in full bloom (July-September). Palace of Sobrellano (Palacio de Sobrellano), tickets €5, open 10:00-15:30 on Sundays. Next to it is a cultural center. The blue-patterned main gate is very photogenic. These two attractions are close to each other and share a medium-sized free parking lot, which also has free public restrooms, making it very convenient. Restaurant: El Remedio, an exquisite seaside restaurant located between Santander and Comillas. It features an old house, a church, a garden, and a cliffside beach. Rated 4.6, highly recommended in the summer. Days 5-6 | Santander → Covadonga (2 nights) Accommodation: HOTEL CERRO LA NINA, €837 for 2 nights (approx. ¥6600), a mountaintop hotel with breathtaking views. Attraction 1: Mirador de Entrelagos (Lakes of Covadonga). You need to take a special bus into the mountains, €8 per person. There are mainly 2 glacial lakes and 1 mine, suitable for a 2-3 hour hike. Attraction 2: The pink-walled Basilica of Covadonga, free entry. There’s a special bus stop nearby. Not far from it is the Holy Cave, a sanctuary built into a cave with a mystical atmosphere. Town of Cangas de Onís: The largest town near Covadonga, where you can eat, stay, and stock up on supplies. It’s also the starting point for the special bus line. The environment is charming, with a market on weekends. Main attraction: The Roman bridge with a cross. The bridge itself is ordinary, but it’s famous for its religious significance. Hotel Santa Cruz (3-star): Located on the edge of town, nice environment, small rooms, soundproofing unknown. It’s across from restaurant #3 and within walking distance to the town center and the stone bridge. Restaurants: La Madreñería, known for its Cachopo (a breaded beef fillet stuffed with ham, sweet peppers, and white asparagus). The portions are large, so ordering a half portion is recommended. La Sifonería, retro decor, blue chairs, great food. Restaurante Villa María, a manor restaurant. It was booked for a wedding, so we couldn’t try it. Special Experience: Take the main road uphill from the entrance of restaurant #3 to enter a pristine village. It’s a pastoral scene, but the road is narrow. There are wild chestnuts (abundant in October, sweet but some have worms). Highly recommended. Day 7 | Covadonga → Salamanca (passing through Avila) Accommodation: Meliá Las Claras Boutique Hotel Salamanca Sightseeing: University of Salamanca, one of the oldest universities in the world. Look for the frog sculpture, which is said to bring academic success. Salamanca Cathedral (ticket required). Both the exterior and interior are perfect for photos, especially the mysterious astronaut carving. You can climb the tower for a panoramic view of the city, but the stairs are steep, so those with a fear of heights should be cautious. Plaza Mayor, one of the most beautiful squares in Spain. It’s surrounded by cafes and restaurants where you can sunbathe and enjoy a meal. There are often performances in the square, making it very lively. The architecture and sculptures are also great for photos. Casa de las Conchas (House of Shells). A charming two-story building that houses a public library inside, with a small courtyard for resting. The shell carvings are very distinctive, a must-visit for photos. La Clerecía Church. The ticket to the top is only €3.25. From the top, you can see the entire city of Salamanca. There are few tourists, making it excellent for taking photos. Strolling through the university and the old town feels like stepping back in time to an ancient European academic institution. Avila (En route): Known as the “City of Stones” and “City of Saints,” it was declared a World Heritage site in 1985. At an altitude of 1131 meters, it is the highest provincial capital in Spain. Medieval Walls (Muralla Medieval): The best-preserved in Europe, stretching 2.5 km with 6 gates, 88 towers, and about 2500 merlons. You can access the walls from gates like Puerta del Alcázar, Puerta de la Lealtad, and Puerta del Carmen. Ávila Cathedral: Has a fortress-like appearance, a mix of Gothic and Baroque styles. The main altarpiece’s reliquary is a highlight. Basilica of San Vicente, a 12th-century Romanesque building. Inside is the cenotaph of the martyr Saint Vincent and his sisters. The tomb’s decorations depict scenes from their lives. Royal Monastery of Saint Thomas (Real Monasterio de Santo Tomás): A 15th-century Isabelline Gothic style building. The tomb of Prince Juan is a highlight. Convent of Saint Teresa (Convento de Santa Teresa): Built on the site of her birthplace, it includes a Baroque and Neoclassical church, an orchard, and a museum. The Four Posts (Los Cuatro Postes): Located 2 km from the city, beside the road to Salamanca, it’s the best spot for panoramic photos of Ávila. Days 8-9 | Madrid (2 nights) Accommodation: Woohoo Rooms Fuencarral, no meals, ¥2204.33/2 nights, 1 double bed + 2 single beds Centrally located in Madrid, offering easy access to major attractions and food streets on foot or by metro.\nDay 10 | Madrid → Cuenca → Valencia On the last day, we drove to the cliff city of Cuenca. We had lunch at a restaurant next to the Hanging Houses (Casas Colgadas) in Cuenca’s old town, enjoying views of the gorge and taking photos. After lunch, we drove back to Valencia, concluding the northern Spain road trip loop.\nTrip Tips Book tickets and popular restaurants in advance, especially for places like Gaztelugatxe (Dragonstone), museums, and Gaudí’s El Capricho, as they sell out quickly during peak season. Most attractions and restaurants have associated parking lots or free public restrooms. Notably, the two main attractions in Comillas share a free parking lot, making visits hassle-free. The temperature difference between day and night can be significant in high-altitude and mountainous areas, so it’s advisable to bring a jacket. Comfortable walking shoes are a must. For food, try local restaurants and long-standing establishments. Highly-rated small eateries often hold pleasant surprises.

Highly recommended.</li></ul><hr><h2 id=day-7--covadonga--salamanca-passing-through-avila>Day 7 | Covadonga → Salamanca (passing through Avila)<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#day-7--covadonga--salamanca-passing-through-avila>#</a></h2><ul><li><strong>Accommodation</strong>: Meliá Las Claras Boutique Hotel</li><li><strong>Salamanca Sightseeing</strong>:<ol><li>University of Salamanca, one of the oldest universities in the world. Look for the frog sculpture, which is said to bring academic success.</li><li><strong>Salamanca Cathedral</strong> (ticket required). Both the exterior and interior are perfect for photos, especially the mysterious astronaut carving. You can climb the tower for a panoramic view of the city, but the stairs are steep, so those with a fear of heights should be cautious.</li><li><strong>Plaza Mayor</strong>, one of the most beautiful squares in Spain. It&rsquo;s surrounded by cafes and restaurants where you can sunbathe and enjoy a meal. There are often performances in the square, making it very lively. The architecture and sculptures are also great for photos.</li><li><strong>Casa de las Conchas</strong> (House of Shells). A charming two-story building that houses a public library inside, with a small courtyard for resting. The shell carvings are very distinctive, a must-visit for photos.</li><li><strong>La Clerecía Church</strong>. The ticket to the top is only €3.25. From the top, you can see the entire city of Salamanca. There are few tourists, making it excellent for taking photos.</li><li>Strolling through the university and the old town feels like stepping back in time to an ancient European academic institution.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Avila (En route)</strong>:<ol><li>Known as the &ldquo;City of Stones&rdquo; and &ldquo;City of Saints,&rdquo; it was declared a World Heritage site in 1985. At an altitude of 1131 meters, it is the highest provincial capital in Spain.</li><li><strong>Medieval Walls</strong> (Muralla Medieval): The best-preserved in Europe, stretching 2.5 km with 6 gates, 88 towers, and about 2500 merlons. You can access the walls from gates like Puerta del Alcázar, Puerta de la Lealtad, and Puerta del Carmen.</li><li><strong>Ávila Cathedral</strong>: Has a fortress-like appearance, a mix of Gothic and Baroque styles. The main altarpiece&rsquo;s reliquary is a highlight.</li><li><strong>Basilica of San Vicente</strong>, a 12th-century Romanesque building. Inside is the cenotaph of the martyr Saint Vincent and his sisters. The tomb&rsquo;s decorations depict scenes from their lives.</li><li><strong>Royal Monastery of Saint Thomas</strong> (Real Monasterio de Santo Tomás): A 15th-century Isabelline Gothic style building. The tomb of Prince Juan is a highlight.</li><li><strong>Convent of Saint Teresa</strong> (Convento de Santa Teresa): Built on the site of her birthplace, it includes a Baroque and Neoclassical church, an orchard, and a museum.</li><li><strong>The Four Posts</strong> (Los Cuatro Postes): Located 2 km from the city, beside the road to Salamanca, it&rsquo;s the best spot for panoramic photos of Ávila.</li></ol></li></ul><hr><h2 id=days-8-9--madrid-2-nights>Days 8-9 | Madrid (2 nights)<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#days-8-9--madrid-2-nights>#</a></h2><ul><li><strong>Accommodation</strong>: Woohoo Rooms Fuencarral, no meals, ¥2204.33/2 nights, 1 double bed + 2 single beds</li></ul><p>Centrally located in Madrid, offering easy access to major attractions and food streets on foot or by metro.</p><hr><h2 id=day-10--madrid--cuenca--valencia>Day 10 | Madrid → Cuenca → Valencia<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#day-10--madrid--cuenca--valencia>#</a></h2><p>On the last day, we drove to the cliff city of <strong>Cuenca</strong>.
