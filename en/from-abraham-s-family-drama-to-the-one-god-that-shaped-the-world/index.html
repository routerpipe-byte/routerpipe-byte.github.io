A Family Feud: A Soap Opera That Changed Geopolitics All major world-changing events might have started simply because—\nThe first wife couldn’t have children.\nAbraham was a successful entrepreneur, but his first wife, Sarah, was infertile. So:\nHe had his firstborn son with the handmaiden Hagar: Ishmael Later, his first wife miraculously became pregnant and gave birth to a second son: Isaac To avoid a family inheritance dispute, Hagar and her son were exiled to the desert.\nThis ‘struggle between the legitimate and illegitimate sons’ became the most expensive family separation in human history:\nIsaac (the legitimate second son) → Became the ancestor of the Jewish people → And his descendants would later include Moses and Jesus\nIshmael (the illegitimate firstborn son) → Became the ancestor of the Arab people → And from his lineage emerged the Prophet Muhammad\nA Surprising Scientific Coincidence Modern genetics (Y-chromosome haplogroups) has surprisingly corroborated this legend:\nJews are predominantly J2 Arabs are predominantly J1 These two genetic groups did indeed share a common ‘father’ 4,000 years ago.\nSo, the earth-shattering conflict in the Middle East today is, in essence, just two brothers fighting over the family inheritance.\nII. Product Iteration: The History of “Re-skinning” from 1.0 to 3.0 Although the family split, the underlying code for all three brothers is actually the same. The evolution of the three major religions is essentially a series of upgrades to the same software.\n1. Judaism | Bedrock Edition 1.0 Core is the Old Testament A VIP invitation-only product The Jewish people see themselves as God’s ’exclusive beta testers’ Proud, exclusive, and generally doesn’t accept new users 2. Christianity | Global Expansion Edition 2.0 Jesus appeared.\nActing as ‘God’s spokesperson’, he transformed the product from a ‘Jewish exclusive’ to a ‘global universal’ version.\n⚠️ Key Point: Jesus himself never wrote a single word.\nThe New Testament we see today is a ‘memoir’ written by his followers decades later. This means:\nFrom its inception, Christianity has been a history of interpretation.\n3. Islam | Ultimate Patch 3.0 Muhammad believed:\nThe previous two versions were ruined by ‘product managers’.\nSo he released the final, revised version—the Quran.\nA massive ’localization’ effort:\nAbraham → Ibrahim Jesus → Isa Mary → Maryam The logic is simple:\nMy older brothers misinterpreted the scriptures; I’m here to set the record straight.\nIII. The Art of Interpretation: How Did Polygamy “Disappear”? Since the script is roughly the same, why do people live so differently?\nThe text is static, but the right to interpret it is dynamic.\nTake ‘polygamy’ for example.\nMany people think this is a ‘perk’ of a certain religion, but its originator was actually Judaism. In Exodus 21:10, God even thoughtfully provides a ‘guide to taking another wife’:\n“If he takes another wife to himself, he shall not diminish her food, her clothing, or her marital rights.”\nKing Solomon married 700 wives, and God didn’t fire him.\nSo why do Christians practice monogamy now?\nChristianity’s ‘survival instinct’ → In order to spread the faith in the Roman Empire, which practiced monogamy, they simply used their power of interpretation to forcibly change the rules\nJudaism’s ‘going with the flow’ → It wasn’t until around 1000 AD that polygamy was formally abolished\nThe scripture didn’t change. The ‘CEO’, in order to adapt to the market, made a breach-of-contract interpretation of a thousands-of-years-old agreement.\nIV. A Historical Reversal: Who Were the Real Fundamentalists? Today’s social media narrative is:\nWest = Open Middle East = Conservative But 1,000 years ago, the situation was completely reversed.\n1. Veiled Christians 1 Corinthians 11:6 is very clear:\n“For if a wife will not cover her head, then she should cut her hair short.”\nMedieval Europe—\nA woman not covering herself when going out was considered impure Christianity was closed-minded and ignorant Busy burning scientists at the stake 2. The ‘Silicon Valley’ of Baghdad Meanwhile, the Muslim world was a beacon of civilization:\nTranslating Greek philosophy Inventing algebra Extremely tolerant of other faiths As long as you paid a little tax (protection money), everyone was a brother.\nBack then, London was like modern-day Afghanistan, and Baghdad was the New York of its time.\nV. Martin Luther: The ‘Disintermediation Revolution’ of Religion In the 16th century, the reason Christianity could reverse course and move towards secularism was a true business revolution.\nThe Pope in Rome at the time:\nThe world’s largest middleman You had to buy indulgences to get into heaven Martin Luther had enough:\n“All believers are priests.”\nDirect disintermediation.\nIt was like— eliminating the monopoly of physical stores and allowing users to connect directly to the server (God).\nThe effect of this move was immediate:\nThought began to be liberated The Pope was no longer the supreme court Science, reason, and the Industrial Revolution began to take root VI. Conclusion: The Text is a Corpse, Interpretation is the Soul Today, the proportion of Protestants in developed countries continues to decline, and churches have become backdrops for weddings and social events.\nIt’s not that the scriptures have become invalid, but that—\nThe right of interpretation has fulfilled its secularizing mission.\nLooking back at this 4,000-year family feud, you’ll find:\nNo religion is inherently extremist And no doctrine is inherently modern All the conflicts are, in essence, a—\nWar over the right of interpretation\nWhoever can ‘mod’ the text to keep up with the times gets a ticket to modern civilization;\nWhoever clings to the corpse of the text will turn themselves into a pained stone statue.\nHistory is not a cycle, but an infinite war of interpretation.\n","wordCount":"1061","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","dateModified":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"/en/from-abraham-s-family-drama-to-the-one-god-that-shaped-the-world/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"zixia","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=/en/ accesskey=h title="zixia (Alt + H)">zixia</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
