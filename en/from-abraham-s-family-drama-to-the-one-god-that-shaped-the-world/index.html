A Family Feud: The Soap Opera That Changed Geopolitics All major world-changing events might have started simply because—\nThe first wife couldn’t have children.\nAbraham was a successful entrepreneur, but his first wife, Sarah, was infertile. So:\nHe had his first son with the handmaiden Hagar: Ishmael Later, his first wife miraculously became pregnant and gave birth to a second son: Isaac To avoid a family inheritance dispute, Hagar and her son were exiled to the desert.\nThis ‘dispute between the legitimate and illegitimate heirs’ became the most expensive family separation in human history:\nIsaac (the legitimate second son) → Became the ancestor of the Jewish people → And incidentally produced Moses and Jesus among his descendants\nIshmael (the illegitimate first son) → Became the ancestor of the Arab people → And from his descendants emerged the Prophet Muhammad\nA Surprising Scientific Coincidence Modern genetics (Y-chromosome haplogroups) has surprisingly corroborated this legend:\nJewish people are predominantly J2 Arab people are predominantly J1 These two genetic groups did indeed share the same ‘father’ 4,000 years ago.\nSo, the earth-shattering conflict in the Middle East today is, in essence, just two brothers fighting over the family inheritance.\nII. Product Iterations: The History of “Re-skinning” from 1.0 to 3.0 Although the family split, the three brothers’ underlying code is essentially the same. The evolution of the three major religions is essentially the continuous upgrading of the same software.\n1. Judaism | The Foundation 1.0 Core: The Old Testament A VIP invitation-only product The Jewish people see themselves as God’s “exclusive beta testers” Arrogant, exclusive, and generally doesn’t accept new users 2. Christianity | The Global Expansion 2.0 Jesus appeared.\nAs ‘God’s spokesperson,’ he transformed the product from ‘Jewish-exclusive’ to ‘globally universal.’\n⚠️ Key Point: Jesus himself never wrote a single word.\nThe New Testament we see today is a ‘memoir’ written by his followers decades later. This means:\nFrom its inception, Christianity has been a history of interpretation.\n3. Islam | The Ultimate Patch 3.0 Muhammad believed:\nThe previous two versions were ruined by ‘product managers.’\nSo he released the final revised edition—the Quran.\nA grand ’localization’ effort:\nAbraham → Ibrahim Jesus → Isa Mary → Maryam The logic is simple:\nMy older brothers misinterpreted the scriptures, so I’m here to set the record straight.\nIII. The Art of Interpretation: How Did Polygamy “Disappear”? Since the script is roughly the same, why are their ways of life so different?\nThe text is dead, but the right to interpret it is alive.\nTake ‘polygamy’ for example.\nMany people think this is a ‘perk’ of a certain religion, but its originator was actually Judaism. In Exodus 21:10, God even thoughtfully provided a ‘guide to taking concubines’:\n“If he takes another wife to himself, he shall not diminish her food, her clothing, or her marital rights.”\nKing Solomon married 700 wives, and God didn’t fire him.\nSo why do Christians practice monogamy now?\nChristianity’s ‘survival instinct’ → To spread the faith in the Roman Empire, which practiced monogamy, they simply used their right of interpretation to forcibly change the rules\nJudaism’s ‘going with the flow’ → It wasn’t until around 1000 AD that polygamy was formally abolished\nThe scripture didn’t change. The ‘CEO,’ in order to adapt to the market, made a breach-of-contract interpretation of a thousands-of-years-old agreement.\nIV. A Historical Reversal: Who Were the Real Fundamentalists? Today’s social media narrative is:\nThe West = Open The Middle East = Conservative But 1,000 years ago, the situation was completely reversed.\n1. Veiled Christians 1 Corinthians 11:6 states it clearly:\n“For if a wife will not cover her head, then she should cut her hair short.”\nIn medieval Europe—\nAn unveiled woman in public = Impure Christianity was closed-minded and ignorant Busy burning scientists at the stake 2. The “Silicon Valley” of Baghdad Meanwhile, the Muslim world was a beacon of civilization:\nTranslating Greek philosophy Inventing algebra Extremely tolerant of other faiths As long as you paid a small tax (protection money), everyone was a good brother.\nBack then, London was like modern-day Afghanistan, and Baghdad was the New York of its time.\nV. Martin Luther: The “Disintermediation Revolution” in Religion In the 16th century, Christianity’s reversal towards secularism was due to a true business revolution.\nThe Pope in Rome at the time:\nWas the world’s largest middleman You had to buy indulgences to get into heaven Martin Luther couldn’t stand it anymore:\n“The priesthood of all believers.”\nDirect disintermediation.\nIt was equivalent to— Abolishing the monopoly of physical stores and allowing users to connect directly to the server (God).\nThe effect of this move was immediate:\nThought began to be liberated The Pope was no longer the supreme court Science, reason, and the Industrial Revolution began to take root VI. Conclusion: The Text is a Corpse, Interpretation is the Soul Today, the proportion of Protestants in developed countries continues to decline, and churches have become backdrops for weddings and social events.\nIt’s not that the scriptures have become invalid, but rather—\nThe right of interpretation has fulfilled its secularizing mission.\nLooking back at this 4,000-year family feud, you’ll find:\nNo religion is inherently extremist And no doctrine is inherently modern All the conflicts are, in essence, a—\nWar for the right to interpret\nWhoever can ‘mod’ the text with the times, gets a ticket to modern civilization;\nWhoever clings to the dead remains, will turn themselves into a suffering stone statue.\nHistory is not a cycle, but an infinite war of interpretation.\n","wordCount":"1050","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","dateModified":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"/en/from-abraham-s-family-drama-to-the-one-god-that-shaped-the-world/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"zixia","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=/en/ accesskey=h title="zixia (Alt + H)">zixia</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
