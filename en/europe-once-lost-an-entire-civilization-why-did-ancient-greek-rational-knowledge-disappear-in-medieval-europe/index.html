Ancient Greece: The Starting Point of Rational Civilization ** (c. 6th–3rd Century BCE)**\nStarting from the 6th century BCE, Ancient Greece achieved the first true rational leap in human history:\nMathematics was written into an axiomatic system: Elements (Euclid) Philosophy was written as logical arguments (Plato, Aristotle) Natural phenomena began to be explained without mythology But this civilization had an extremely fragile prerequisite:\nIt was highly dependent on language, an educational system, and the transmission of manuscripts.\nII. Plato and Aristotle Not “Ideas,” but a Complete System of Original Works Ancient Greek philosophy is not a “collection of views” pieced together by later generations, but a systematic body of knowledge composed of original works.\nPlato (c. 427–347 BCE)\nHe conducted philosophical training in the form of dialogues:\nThe Republic: Justice, the state, the philosopher-king Symposium: How love ascends from the sensual to the ideal Phaedo: The immortality of the soul Theaetetus: What is “knowledge” Its core is the Theory of Forms: the rational world is superior to the sensory world.\nAristotle (384–322 BCE)\nHe was the first person in human history to systematically organize all branches of knowledge:\nLogic: Organon Ontology: Metaphysics Natural Sciences: Physics, On the Soul Biology: History of Animals Political Ethics: Nicomachean Ethics, Politics 📌 He laid the foundation for logical reasoning, classification methods, and empirical observation.\nIII. A Decisive Prerequisite —All of This Was Written in Greek These works were all written in the highly abstract Greek language, relying on an academic educational system and a tradition of manuscript copying.\nOnce the language was broken and the institutions collapsed, knowledge would not “slowly decline” but would crash directly.\nIV. Rome Inherited from Greece but Failed to Disseminate the Knowledge (From 146 BCE onwards)\nAfter Rome conquered Greece, society became clearly stratified:\nUpper elite: Greek language, Greek philosophy Common people and the military: Latin 📌 The language of knowledge and the language of society diverged.\nRome inherited the achievements but failed to establish a universal system for education and knowledge transmission.\nV. The Establishment of Christianity as the State Religion —The Transfer of Knowledge Legitimacy (380 CE) In 380 CE, the Roman Empire established Christianity as the state religion.\nFrom then on:\nSource of truth → The Bible Right of interpretation → The Church Classical philosophy and natural studies → Pagan heritage Reason did not disappear immediately, but it began to gradually lose institutional protection.\nVI. After the Fall of the Western Roman Empire Did Europeans Really “Bathe Only Three Times in Their Lives”? In 476 CE, the Germanic mercenary leader Odoacer deposed the Western Roman Emperor Romulus Augustulus.\nAfter the fall of the Western Roman Empire, it wasn’t just philosophy and science that were fractured, but daily civilization itself.\nOne of the most intuitive and easily understood examples is bathing.\nIn the Roman era:\nPublic baths were widespread in cities Hot and cold water systems, underfloor heating, and sewers were all in place Bathing was both for hygiene and for socializing In medieval Western Europe:\nCities declined, and public baths largely disappeared The Church’s vigilance against “nudity and pleasure” increased The idea that “bathing causes illness” became prevalent This led to the popular saying we hear today:\n“Medieval Europeans only bathed three times in their lives: at birth, marriage, and death.”\nThis is not a complete fabrication—“bathe as little as possible” and “not bathing is healthier” were indeed treated as a serious life philosophy in late medieval Western Europe.\nWhen institutions and urban civilization collapse, humans may even voluntarily abandon the life technologies they have already mastered.\nVII. The Divergence of Civilizations Greek Civilization Survived in the Eastern Roman Empire Meanwhile, in the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire:\nThe official and church language was still Greek The original works of Plato and Aristotle were systematically preserved Continuity was maintained in cities, education, and administration But after the East-West Schism in 1054, knowledge was completely isolated by religious and political boundaries.\nVIII. How the Islamic World Received Greek Civilization (8th–10th Centuries)\nCompletely contrary to today’s stereotypes, the Islamic world of the 8th–10th centuries was one of the most rational, prosperous, and cosmopolitan civilizations of its time.\nAfter the establishment of the Abbasid Caliphate (750 CE):\nIn the 9th century, the “House of Wisdom” was established in Baghdad Greek philosophy, mathematics, and medicine were systematically translated Plato, Aristotle, and Euclid were fully translated and introduced More importantly:\nThey not only translated, but also studied, collated, and developed the works.\nWhen medieval Europeans first truly entered Byzantine and Islamic cities, what they saw was not “pagan wilderness,” but:\nRunning water systems and public baths Hospitals, pharmacies, and university-like institutions Prosperous urban life and international trade networks 📌 This is not praise fabricated by later generations, but a real shock that repeatedly appears in Crusader documents.\nIX. Jerusalem: Different Attitudes Towards Non-believers This civilizational difference was particularly evident in Jerusalem.\nIn 1099, the Crusaders captured Jerusalem:\nA large-scale massacre of the city Civilians were indiscriminately slaughtered Jerusalem under Muslim rule:\nNon-believers were allowed to keep their faith They could freely choose to stay or leave They only needed to pay a poll tax to live there This is not a moral judgment, but an institutional fact:\nOnly a society that allows multiple faiths to coexist has the space to preserve “pagan” knowledge.\nX. Multiple Paths Greek Civilization’s “Detour Home” Greek knowledge did not suddenly “revive” in Europe one day; it underwent a long and tortuous civilizational transfer.\nThree key paths:\nThe Fourth Crusade (1204) The Crusaders did not go to Muslim territories but instead sacked Constantinople, and a large number of Greek manuscripts were brought back to Western Europe. The Arabic-to-Latin translation movement on the Iberian Peninsula European scholars proactively traveled to Muslim-ruled areas to study, re-engaging with classical works by Aristotle, Euclid, and others through Arabic translations. The westward migration of scholars after the fall of Constantinople in 1453 Byzantine scholars fled to Italy with original Greek texts, directly fueling the humanistic and academic revival of the early Renaissance. In this path of return, the transmission sequence of Greek civilization is clear:\nGreek → Arabic → Latin → Europe\nThis was not a revival of antiquity, but a cross-civilizational, cross-linguistic, and cross-religious return of knowledge.\nXI. A Decisive Rebuttal to the “Falsified Western History” Theory In recent years, a theory has become popular:\n“Ancient Greek civilization was fabricated after the Renaissance.”\nBut this claim is untenable both logically and evidentially:\nOriginal Greek works were preserved in Byzantium They were independently translated by the rival civilization of the Arab world And then translated back from Arabic into Latin 📌 This is cross-verification across multiple civilizations, languages, and religions.\nIf it were a fabrication, one would have to assume that:\nChristian civilization Islamic civilization Byzantine civilization collaborated in a forgery for centuries while being long-term adversaries—which is historically impossible.\nXII. The Protestant Reformation Reason Finally Regains Legitimacy Even after knowledge returned to Europe, it was not “safe” at first.\nIt wasn’t until after the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century that Europe’s intellectual environment underwent a fundamental change.\nWith the unfolding of Martin Luther’s Reformation:\nThe absolute authority of the Pope was weakened Individual reading and interpretation were recognized Scholarship gradually broke free from direct theological censorship Ancient Greek reason was finally no longer a “dangerous pagan heritage.” It once again became a knowledge system that was permitted, studied, and developed.\nXIII. How Greek Civilization Ignited the Renaissance (15th–17th Centuries)\nWhen this knowledge re-entered Europe, it directly stimulated the birth of a generation of geniuses.\nLeonardo da Vinci: Anatomy, proportion, perspective Galileo: Describing nature with mathematics, a direct inheritance of the Ancient Greek scientific spirit 📌 They did not appear out of thin air; they were standing on the shoulders of Ancient Greece once again.\nConclusion Civilizations Neither Disappear Nor Appear from Nothing The knowledge of Ancient Greece and Rome:\nWas not fabricated Nor did it die out naturally It was merely obstructed by:\nLinguistic rupture Institutional collapse Religious monopoly Political isolation When the conditions were restored, reason naturally returned.\nHistory is not a matter of emotion, but a matter of evidence.\n","wordCount":"1494","inLanguage":"zh","datePublished":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","dateModified":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"/en/europe-once-lost-an-entire-civilization-why-did-ancient-greek-rational-knowledge-disappear-in-medieval-europe/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"zixia","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=/zh/ accesskey=h title="zixia (Alt + H)">zixia</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
