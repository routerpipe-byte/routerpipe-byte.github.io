Many people use it, but few know that: idealista allows you to freely check a property’s cadastral information, historical price charts for sales and rentals, and view information about surrounding amenities and average prices.\nThis article combines two parts:\nHow to use idealista to perform a “semi-due diligence” for free; The complete process of a second-hand property transaction in Spain (from screening to notarization, transfer, and tax payment), along with very specific tips to avoid pitfalls. I. Free Inquiries on idealista: Valuation, Cadastral Info, Historical Price Curves, and Local Amenities Visit: https://www.idealista.com/zh/maps/\n1) Search by Address Enter the property’s address to start the search.\n2) Select the Building Number 3) View Basic Property Information and Valuation This will display the property’s:\nArea Year of construction Sale valuation Rental valuation 4) Scroll Down: Cadastral Information Download, Building Structure Information Scrolling down reveals the option to download cadastral information and details about the building’s structure.\n5) Nota Simple (Very Important) The cadastral information, or nota simple, includes:\nTransaction history Information on whether there are outstanding mortgages, etc. 6) Surrounding Area Information: Transportation, Education, Healthcare, Shopping Information on nearby transportation and education.\nHealthcare and shopping information near the property.\n7) Price Report: Historical Transaction Price Curve Click on the price report to see the historical transaction prices for the area.\nYou can see that Spanish property prices fluctuate very little:\nThis example shows villa prices: villas are almost exclusively for personal use and have little investment value. Apartment prices in Spain have seen greater increases: apartments offer a higher return on investment. II. Market and Settlement Assessment: Rental Yield, Regional Climate, and City Selection The rental yield for properties in popular Spanish cities is around 7%, and there is a high demand for low-rent properties. Affordable and conveniently located apartments have greater investment value. Differences Between Spanish Regions (Climate/Cost of Living/Environment) The North (bordering France, facing the Atlantic Ocean)\nHumid climate, lush vegetation Cool summers, cold winters High cost of living Clean cities Scenery similar to Switzerland Central and Southern Regions\nDry climate, sparse vegetation Dusty during high winds Hot summers Relatively low cost of living From the perspective of convenient transportation, pleasant climate, developed economy, and vibrancy: Barcelona is the most suitable region in Spain for settling down.\nIII. Tips (Very practical, it’s recommended to follow them one by one) The southern and central regions of Spain are semi-arid. During heavy rainfall, houses are prone to flooding, and flood disasters occur almost annually. Therefore, when choosing a house in the central-southern regions, try to select one in a densely populated, higher-elevation area. When viewing a property, check the basement for any signs of past flooding.\nReal estate agent fees are typically 3% of the property price. If the price exceeds â¬200,000, this is generally negotiable.\nBefore making an offer, you should carefully review the cadastral information (nota simple) to avoid purchasing a property with an outstanding mortgage or complex ownership issues.\nIf you are bold and meticulous, you can use the photos on property websites to locate the house and contact the owner directly by knocking on their door. This can save a significant amount in agent fees, but not every owner is willing to bypass their agent.\nThe property transfer tax is approximately 10% of the property price. You must pay this tax yourself at the bank. Do not transfer the money to the agent to pay on your behalf. Having an agent handle the tax payment is very risky.\nProperty transactions are relatively straightforward, and a lawyer is not always necessary. Chinese lawyers generally charge around 1%, while Spanish lawyers are cheaper, and you can negotiate a per-service fee of a few hundred euros. You can also use translation software to translate the contract yourself or hire an experienced translator to review it.\nThe most important part of a property transaction is the notarization of the entire process at a notary’s office. Therefore, you must verify the notary’s credentials to ensure they are a legally licensed professional. All legal notaries in Spain must be registered with the General Council of Notaries (Consejo General del Notariado - CGN). You can find a directory of legal notaries by visiting https://www.notariado.org/.\nOn the idealista property website, you can freely check a property’s cadastral information, sale valuation, as well as the average price of nearby properties, historical transaction price curves, and information on local amenities. Use idealista to check cadastral information for free.\nSpanish property prices are stable, and a house’s value is mainly reflected in its construction cost. The construction cost of new homes today is much higher than it was 10 or 20 years ago, with significant increases in labor and material prices. Therefore, new homes are much more expensive than old ones, often more than double the price. Furthermore, the materials and construction methods used in new homes are not necessarily as sturdy as those used in houses built around the year 2000. Consequently, choosing a second-hand house from around 2000 is the most cost-effective option. In Spain, very few people buy new homes or build their own.\nThe EU has strict anti-money laundering policies, and the scrutiny of the source of funds for purchasing new properties is also very rigorous.\nIV. The General Process for Buying Second-hand Property in Spain (Complete steps, follow this guide) Screen properties on second-hand property websites;\nContact the agent for viewings;\nSign a viewing agreement (Before signing, be sure to confirm the contents of the agreement, such as exclusivity clauses, agent fees, etc. If you do not agree with the terms, refuse to sign);\nAfter showing interest: Pay a reservation deposit (usually proposed by the agent) The agent will typically ask the buyer to pay a reservation deposit, the amount of which is usually specified in the agency agreement. The contract will generally stipulate:\nIf a contract is reached with the seller at the buyer’s proposed price, the reservation deposit automatically becomes the agent’s fee; If an agreement cannot be reached with the seller, the reservation deposit will be fully refunded within a week. These terms are negotiable and not standard. Sign the purchase contract with the seller (core terms must be clear) The contract generally includes: Total property price Deposit amount Notarization date Final payment date Property handover date A deposit is usually paid to the seller upon signing the contract, typically around 10% of the property price. Spanish banks generally have a daily transfer limit of â¬50,000. Be sure to arrange a temporary authorization for a large transfer with your bank manager in advance, or issue a bank check. The payment method for the deposit needs to be confirmed with the seller to avoid disputes. Notarization (The most critical step: on-site closing, checks, identity verification) During notarization, be sure to check if the notary’s information is listed on the official website of the General Council of Notaries and if they are qualified to handle property transactions. The final payment is usually made by bank check: You hand over the check You receive the keys to the property The notary witnesses this exchange on-site. You will need to contact your bank in advance to have the check issued. Pay close attention to the payee’s name on the check and confirm it with the seller beforehand. Changing property registration information after the transaction (can usually be handled by an agent) The agent or the notary’s office will usually handle the change of property registration information after the transaction. The fee is not high, around â¬200, and the process takes about 2 months. It is recommended to use this service. After the property information is updated, you will receive an email and SMS notification from the government.\nPaying the property transfer tax (reiterating: do not let the agent pay on your behalf) The property transfer tax is generally 10% of the property price: Absolutely do not let the agent pay it for you, as this can easily lead to problems. The correct procedure is: have the agent give you the tax payment form, and then go to the bank to pay it yourself. After the bank stamps the form, give it back to the agent to use for updating the property registration information.\nSettling fees and transferring utilities (water, electricity, gas, community fees, waste disposal, property tax, etc.) The settlement of fees and transfer of services like water, electricity, gas, community fees, waste disposal, and property tax (IBI) generally require the cooperation of the owner or can be handled by the agent. Property tax is paid annually. The property tax in Spain is very low, approximately 0.3% of the property value per year, with slight variations between regions.\n","wordCount":"1474","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2026-02-05T16:58:00Z","dateModified":"2026-02-05T16:58:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"/en/a-complete-guide-to-buying-second-hand-property-in-spain-idealista-cadastral-check-nota-simple-avoiding-pitfalls-in-notarization-and-transfer/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"zixia","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=/en/ accesskey=h title="zixia (Alt + H)">zixia</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">

The construction cost of new homes today is much higher than it was 10 or 20 years ago, with significant increases in labor and material prices. Therefore, new homes are much more expensive than old ones, often more than double the price. Furthermore, the materials and construction methods used in new homes are not necessarily as sturdy as those used in houses built around the year 2000. Consequently, choosing a second-hand house from around 2000 is the most cost-effective option. In Spain, very few people buy new homes or build their own.</p></li><li><p>The EU has strict anti-money laundering policies, and the scrutiny of the source of funds for purchasing new properties is also very rigorous.</p></li></ol><hr><h2 id=iv-the-general-process-for-buying-second-hand-property-in-spain-complete-steps-follow-this-guide>IV. The General Process for Buying Second-hand Property in Spain (Complete steps, follow this guide)<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#iv-the-general-process-for-buying-second-hand-property-in-spain-complete-steps-follow-this-guide>#</a></h2><ol><li><p>Screen properties on second-hand property websites;</p></li><li><p>Contact the agent for viewings;</p></li><li><p>Sign a viewing agreement
(Before signing, be sure to confirm the contents of the agreement, such as exclusivity clauses, agent fees, etc. If you do not agree with the terms, refuse to sign);</p></li><li><p>After showing interest: Pay a reservation deposit (usually proposed by the agent)
The agent will typically ask the buyer to pay a reservation deposit, the amount of which is usually specified in the agency agreement.
The contract will generally stipulate:</p></li></ol><ul><li>If a contract is reached with the seller at the buyer&rsquo;s proposed price, the reservation deposit automatically becomes the agent&rsquo;s fee;</li><li>If an agreement cannot be reached with the seller, the reservation deposit will be fully refunded within a week.
These terms are negotiable and not standard.</li></ul><ol start=5><li>Sign the purchase contract with the seller (core terms must be clear)
The contract generally includes:</li></ol><ul><li>Total property price</li><li>Deposit amount</li><li>Notarization date</li><li>Final payment date</li><li>Property handover date
A deposit is usually paid to the seller upon signing the contract, typically around 10% of the property price.
Spanish banks generally have a daily transfer limit of â¬50,000. Be sure to arrange a temporary authorization for a large transfer with your bank manager in advance, or issue a bank check. The payment method for the deposit needs to be confirmed with the seller to avoid disputes.</li></ul><ol start=6><li>Notarization (The most critical step: on-site closing, checks, identity verification)
During notarization, be sure to check if the notary&rsquo;s information is listed on the official website of the General Council of Notaries and if they are qualified to handle property transactions.
The final payment is usually made by bank check:</li></ol><ul><li>You hand over the check</li><li>You receive the keys to the property
The notary witnesses this exchange on-site.
You will need to contact your bank in advance to have the check issued.
Pay close attention to the payee&rsquo;s name on the check and confirm it with the seller beforehand.</li></ul><ol start=7><li><p>Changing property registration information after the transaction (can usually be handled by an agent)
The agent or the notary&rsquo;s office will usually handle the change of property registration information after the transaction. The fee is not high, around â¬200, and the process takes about 2 months.
It is recommended to use this service. After the property information is updated, you will receive an email and SMS notification from the government.</p></li><li><p>Paying the property transfer tax (reiterating: do not let the agent pay on your behalf)
The property transfer tax is generally 10% of the property price:
Absolutely do not let the agent pay it for you, as this can easily lead to problems.
The correct procedure is: have the agent give you the tax payment form, and then go to the bank to pay it yourself.
After the bank stamps the form, give it back to the agent to use for updating the property registration information.</p></li><li><p>Settling fees and transferring utilities (water, electricity, gas, community fees, waste disposal, property tax, etc.)
The settlement of fees and transfer of services like water, electricity, gas, community fees, waste disposal, and property tax (IBI) generally require the cooperation of the owner or can be handled by the agent.
Property tax is paid annually. The property tax in Spain is very low, approximately 0.3% of the property value per year, with slight variations between regions.</p></li></ol></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul></footer><div class=comments><script src=https://giscus.app/client.js data-repo=routerpipe-byte/routerpipe-byte.github.io data-repo-id=R_kgDORGxuaA data-category="zixia Comments" data-category-id=DIC_kwDORGxuaM4C15FB data-mapping=pathname data-strict=0 data-reactions-enabled=1 data-emit-metadata=0 data-input-position=bottom data-theme=preferred_color_scheme data-lang=en crossorigin=anonymous async></script></div></article></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2026 <a href=/en/>zixia</a></span> ·
