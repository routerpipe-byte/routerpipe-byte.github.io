A Family Feud: A Soap Opera That Changed Geopolitics All major world-changing events may have initially started because—\nThe first wife couldn’t have children.\nAbraham was a successful entrepreneur, but his first wife, Sarah, was infertile.\nSo:\nHe had his first son with his maidservant Hagar: Ishmael Later, his first wife miraculously became pregnant and gave birth to a second son: Isaac To avoid a family inheritance dispute, Hagar and her son were exiled to the desert.\nThis “struggle between the legitimate and illegitimate sons” became the most expensive family separation in human history:\nIsaac (the legitimate second son)\n→ Became the ancestor of the Jewish people\n→ And his descendants later included Moses and Jesus\nIshmael (the illegitimate first son)\n→ Became the ancestor of the Arab people\n→ And his descendants included the Prophet Muhammad\nA Miraculous Scientific Coincidence Modern genetics (Y-chromosome haplogroups) has surprisingly corroborated this legend:\nJewish people are predominantly J2 Arab people are predominantly J1 These two genetic groups did indeed share the same “dad” 4,000 years ago.\nIt turns out, the earth-shattering conflict in the Middle East today is, in essence, just two brothers fighting over the family inheritance.\nII. Product Iteration: The History of “Re-skinning” from 1.0 to 3.0 Although the family split, the underlying code for all three brothers is the same.\nThe evolution of the three major religions is essentially the continuous upgrading of the same software.\n1. Judaism | Bedrock Edition 1.0 Core is the Old Testament A VIP invitation-only product The Jewish people consider themselves God’s “exclusive beta testers” Arrogant, exclusive, and generally doesn’t accept new users 2. Christianity | International Promotion Edition 2.0 Jesus appeared.\nAs a “spokesperson for God,” he transformed the product from “Jewish-exclusive” to “globally universal.”\n⚠️ Key Point:\nJesus himself never wrote a single word.\nWhat we see as the New Testament are the “memoirs” written by his followers decades later.\nThis means:\nFrom its inception, Christianity has been a history of interpretation.\n3. Islam | Ultimate Patch Edition 3.0 Muhammad believed:\nThe previous two versions were ruined by “product managers.”\nSo he directly released the final revised edition—the Quran.\nA grand “localization” scene:\nAbraham → Ibrahim Jesus → Isa Mary → Maryam The logic is simple:\nMy older brothers misinterpreted the scriptures, so I’m here to set the record straight.\nIII. The Art of Interpretation: How Did Polygamy “Disappear”? Since the script is roughly the same, why do people live so differently?\nThe text is dead, but the right to interpret it is alive.\nTake “polygamy” as an example.\nMany people think it’s a “perk” of a certain religion, but its originator is Judaism.\nIn Exodus 21:10, God even thoughtfully provides a “concubine guide”:\n“If he takes another wife to himself, he shall not diminish her food, her clothing, or her marital rights.”\nKing Solomon married 700 wives, and God didn’t fire him.\nSo why do Christians practice monogamy now?\nChristianity’s “survival instinct”\n→ In order to spread the faith in the monogamous Roman Empire, they simply used their power of interpretation to forcibly change the rules.\nJudaism’s “going with the flow”\n→ It wasn’t until around 1000 AD that polygamy was formally abolished.\nThe scripture didn’t change; the ‘CEOs,’ in order to adapt to the market, offered a breach-of-contract interpretation of a millennia-old agreement.\nIV. History’s Reversal: Who Were the Real Fundamentalists? Today’s social media narrative is:\nThe West = Open The Middle East = Conservative But 1,000 years ago, this was a major plot twist.\n1. Veiled Christians 1 Corinthians 11:6 makes it very clear:\n“For if a wife will not cover her head, then she should cut her hair short.”\nIn medieval Europe—\nA woman going out without being properly covered = impure Christianity was closed-minded and ignorant Busy burning scientists at the stake 2. “Silicon Valley” Baghdad Meanwhile, the Muslim world was a beacon of civilization:\nTranslating Greek philosophy Inventing algebra Extremely tolerant of non-believers As long as you paid a small tax (protection fee), everyone was a good brother.\nBack then, London was like modern-day Afghanistan,\nand Baghdad was the New York of its time.\nV. Martin Luther: The “Disintermediation Revolution” of Religion In the 16th century, the reason Christianity could reverse course and become secular was due to a true business revolution.\nThe Roman Pope at the time:\nThe world’s largest middleman To get into heaven, you had to buy indulgences Martin Luther couldn’t stand it anymore:\n“All believers are priests.”\nDirect disintermediation.\nIt was equivalent to—\nAbolishing the monopoly of physical stores and allowing users to connect directly to the server (God).\nThe effect of this move was immediate:\nThought began to be liberated The Pope was no longer the supreme law Science, reason, and the Industrial Revolution began to take root VI. Conclusion: The Text is a Corpse, Interpretation is the Soul Today, the proportion of Protestants in developed countries continues to decline, and churches have become backdrops for weddings and social events.\nIt’s not that the scriptures have lost their power, but that—\nthe right of interpretation has completed its secular mission.\nLooking back at this 4,000-year family drama, you’ll find:\nNo religion is inherently extreme And no doctrine is inherently modern All the conflicts are, in essence, a—\nwar over the right of interpretation\nWhoever can “mod” the text to keep up with the times gets a ticket to modern civilization;\nWhoever clings to the corpse of the text\nwill turn themselves into a pained, living statue.\nHistory is not a cycle, but an infinite war of interpretation.\n","wordCount":"1058","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","dateModified":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.houdao.org/en/from-abraham-s-family-drama-to-the-global-one-god/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"zixia","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://www.houdao.org/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://www.houdao.org/en/ accesskey=h title="zixia (Alt + H)">zixia</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
