The ancient Greeks, on the other hand, raised a group of ‘superpowered man-children’ on Mount Olympus. Zeus and his family, instead of doing anything productive, spent their days having affairs and engaging in drama.\nBut eventually, a more efficient and monopolistic business model emerged:\nMonotheism\nThe logic was perfectly self-consistent— there’s only one ‘Big Boss’ in the heavens, so the mortal world only needs one ‘CEO’.\nAnd the founder of this monopolistic enterprise was none other than—Abraham (also known as Ibrahim).\nI. A Family Feud: A Drama That Reshaped Geopolitics All major world-changing events might have started simply because—\nThe first wife couldn’t have children.\nAbraham was a successful entrepreneur, but he had a secret problem: his first wife, Sarah, was infertile.\nSo—\nHe had his first son with the handmaiden Hagar: Ishmael. Later, his first wife miraculously became pregnant and gave birth to a second son: Isaac. To avoid a family inheritance dispute, Hagar and her son were exiled to the desert.\nThis ‘dispute between the legitimate and illegitimate sons’ became the most expensive family separation in human history:\nIsaac (the legitimate second son) → Became the ancestor of the Jewish people → And incidentally produced Moses and Jesus among his descendants. Ishmael (the illegitimate first son) → Became the ancestor of the Arab people → And from his descendants emerged the Prophet Muhammad. A fascinating scientific coincidence: Modern genetics (Y-chromosome haplogroups) has surprisingly corroborated this legend—\nJewish people are predominantly J2. Arab people are predominantly J1. These two gene groups indeed shared the same ‘father’ about 4,000 years ago.\nSo, it turns out, the earth-shattering conflict in the Middle East today is, in essence, just two brothers fighting over the family inheritance.\nII. Product Iteration: The History of ‘Re-skinning’ from 1.0 to 3.0 Although the family split, the underlying code for the three brothers’ ventures is actually the same.\nThe evolution of these three major religions is essentially the continuous upgrading of the same piece of software.\nJudaism | Foundation Version 1.0 Core: The Old Testament A VIP, invitation-only product The Jewish people see themselves as God’s ’exclusive beta testers’. Arrogant, exclusive, and generally doesn’t accept new users. Christianity | Global Expansion Version 2.0 Then Jesus appeared.\nAs God’s ‘spokesperson’, he transformed the product from ‘Jewish-exclusive’ to ‘globally accessible’.\n⚠️ Here’s the key point:\nJesus himself never wrote a single word.\nThe New Testament we read today is a ‘memoir’ written by his followers decades later.\nThis means: from its very inception, Christianity has been a history of interpretation.\nIslam | The Ultimate Patch 3.0 Muhammad believed:\nThe previous two versions were ruined by their ‘product managers’.\nSo he released the final, revised edition—the Quran.\nA massive ’localization’ effort:\nAbraham → Ibrahim Jesus → Isa Mary → Maryam The logic is simple:\nMy older brothers misinterpreted the scriptures; I’m here to set the record straight.\nIII. The Art of Interpretation: How Did Polygamy ‘Disappear’? If the script is basically the same, why do people live so differently?\nThe answer is a single sentence:\nThe text is static, but the power of interpretation is dynamic.\nTake ‘polygamy’ for example.\nMany people think this is a ‘perk’ of a certain religion, but its originator was actually Judaism.\nIn Exodus 21:10, God even thoughtfully provided a ‘guide to taking concubines’:\n“If he takes another wife to himself, he shall not diminish her food, her clothing, or her marital rights.”\nKing Solomon married 700 wives, and God didn’t fire him.\nSo why do Christians practice monogamy now?\nChristianity’s ‘survival instinct’ In order to spread the faith in the Roman Empire, which practiced monogamy, they simply used their power of interpretation to forcibly change the rules. Judaism’s ‘going with the flow’ It wasn’t until around 1000 AD that polygamy was formally abolished. The scripture didn’t change. The CEOs, in order to adapt to the market, made a breach-of-contract interpretation of a thousands-of-years-old agreement.\n","wordCount":"695","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","dateModified":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"/en/from-abraham-s-family-drama-to-the-global-one-god/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"zixia","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=/en/ accesskey=h title="zixia (Alt + H)">zixia</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
