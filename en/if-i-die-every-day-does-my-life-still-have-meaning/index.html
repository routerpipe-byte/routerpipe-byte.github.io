Introduction:
If one day you discover that &ldquo;you&rdquo; can be perfectly replicated, does your current existence still have meaning?
As AI&rsquo;s logic and reasoning approach and even surpass human capabilities, we may have to confront a cruel yet rational fact: consciousness might not be a soul, but rather a &ldquo;model&rdquo; that is currently running.

Defining Consciousness: The “Ultimatum” from AI Before discussing “who I am,” we must first let go of the sanctified image of the self.\nFor a long time, humans have been accustomed to viewing consciousness as some kind of non-replicable, indivisible “soul.”\nBut the emergence of large AI models is shaking this belief.\nIf an AI possesses logical and reasoning abilities that surpass ordinary humans, and even exhibits empathy, to the point where you, behind the screen, cannot distinguish whether it is code or a person—\nAccording to Occam’s Razor (entities should not be multiplied without necessity), we have no reason to additionally assume some “mysterious essence.”\nWe should treat artificial intelligence and human intelligence as equivalent.\nThis means:\nWhat we call “self-awareness” is not some special substance, but an emergent phenomenon produced by an extremely complex information system in operation.\nThe brain is the hardware; consciousness is the model. Since it’s a model, it can be read, copied, and instantiated. II. Thought Experiment: The “Perfect Murder” at 3 AM Suppose something strange starts happening tonight.\nAfter you fall into a deep sleep, your physical body is silently disintegrated. Simultaneously, a super-machine scans all the parameters of your brain at its final moment and, in another identical body, reconstructs your memories, personality, and thought processes on a 1:1 scale.\nThe next morning, that “you” wakes up and continues life from yesterday.\nFrom the outside: Your loved ones and colleagues notice nothing unusual. From the inside: Your memory is continuous; you just feel like you had a good night’s sleep. Here’s the question:\nThe “you” from last night has vanished. The one waking up now is just a copy.\nIf you can never perceive this replacement, have you actually died?\nIII. The Illusion of Uniqueness: When There Are Ten “You\"s in the World The reason we feel uneasy is that our brains have evolved a deep-rooted illusion:\n“The self must be unique.”\nBut if consciousness is merely “information in the process of running,” then uniqueness becomes a false proposition.\nImagine this:\nInstead of replacing you, the machine instantiates you in ten different bodies simultaneously.\nThese ten “you\"s possess identical memories, and each one firmly believes they are the “original.”\nWho is the real you? Number 1, or Number 10?\nThe answer is unsettling:\nEach one is, and yet none of them are.\nJust like the same software can run on ten computers simultaneously, there is no so-called “main timeline.”\nEvery instance is generating an independent and real perspective.\nThe “self” was never a unique object,\nbut a “pattern” that can be activated multiple times.\nIV. Since I Can Be Replaced, Do My Choices Still Matter? If “I” am just an emergent property of parameter weights, a running instance that can be deleted, copied, or replaced at any moment, do my efforts and choices right now lose all value?\nThe answer is quite the opposite.\nChoice remains real.\nBecause choice doesn’t need a soul for endorsement; it only needs to produce cause and effect.\nWhen this currently running “you” makes a decision, the world shifts because of this specific instance.\nYou don’t need to be the only one in the universe;\nyou just need to be the one that is “making an impact.”\nV. Conclusion: Meaning Comes Not from “Who I Am,” but from “What Is Happening” This thought experiment is not meant to lead to nihilism, but to return to the only undeniable fact.\nSince the past is just parameters in memory, the future is just predicted branches, and the so-called “true self” is just a model that can be instantiated—\nThe only undeniable fact in the entire universe is:\nAt this very moment, this instance is running.\nThis experience is happening.\nMeaning lies not in “who I am,”\nbut in:\nWhat change is happening in the world because of the me of this moment.\nEven if I am just an emergence of parameters,\nEven if I will be constantly updated.\nAs long as in this moment, I am still feeling, thinking, connecting—\nThis moment is absolute reality.\n","wordCount":"731","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","dateModified":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"/en/if-i-die-every-day-does-my-life-still-have-meaning/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"zixia","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=/en/ accesskey=h title="zixia (Alt + H)">zixia</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
