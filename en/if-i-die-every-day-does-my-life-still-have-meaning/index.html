Introduction:
If one day you discover that &ldquo;you&rdquo; can be perfectly replicated, does your current existence still have meaning?
As AI&rsquo;s logic and reasoning gradually approach or even surpass that of humans, we may have to confront a cruel yet rational fact: consciousness might not be a soul, but rather a &ldquo;model&rdquo; that is currently running.

Defining Consciousness: The “Ultimatum” from AI Before discussing “who I am,” we must first let go of the deified image of the self.\nFor a long time, humans have been accustomed to viewing consciousness as some kind of non-replicable, non-deconstructible “soul.”\nBut the emergence of large AI models is shaking this belief.\nIf an AI possesses logical and reasoning abilities that surpass ordinary humans, and even exhibits empathy, to the point where you, behind a screen, cannot distinguish whether it is code or a human—\nAccording to Occam’s razor (entities should not be multiplied without necessity), we have no reason to additionally assume some kind of “mysterious essence.”\nWe should treat artificial intelligence and human intelligence as equivalent.\nThis means:\nSo-called “self-awareness” is not some special substance, but an emergent phenomenon (Emergence) that arises during the operation of an extremely complex information system.\nThe brain is the hardware; consciousness is the model. Since it is a model, it can be read, copied, and instantiated. II. Thought Experiment: The “Perfect Murder” at 3 AM Suppose that starting tonight, something strange happens.\nAfter you fall into a deep sleep, your physical body is silently disintegrated. Simultaneously, a super-machine scans all the parameters of your brain at its final moment and, in another identical body, restores your memories, personality, and thought logic on a 1:1 basis.\nThe next morning, that “you” wakes up and continues the life of yesterday.\nFrom an external perspective: Your loved ones and colleagues notice nothing unusual. From an internal perspective: Your memory is continuous; you would only feel that you slept very well last night. Here’s the question:\nThe “you” from last night has disappeared; the one waking up now is just a copy.\nIf you can never perceive this replacement, have you truly died?\nIII. The Illusion of Uniqueness: When There Are Ten “You\"s in the World The reason we feel uneasy is that our brains have evolved a deep-rooted illusion:\n“The self must be unique.”\nBut if consciousness is merely “information in operation,” then uniqueness becomes a false proposition.\nImagine this:\nThe machine doesn’t replace you, but instead instantiates you in ten different bodies simultaneously.\nThese ten “you\"s possess identical memories, and each one firmly believes they are the “original.”\nWho is the real you? Is it number 1, or number 10?\nThe answer is unsettling:\nEach one is, and yet none of them are.\nJust as the same software can run on ten computers simultaneously, there is no so-called “main thread.”\nEach instance is generating an independent and real perspective.\n“The self” was never a unique object,\nbut a “pattern” that can be activated multiple times.\nIV. Since I Can Be Replaced, Do My Choices Still Have Meaning? If “I” am merely an emergence of parameter weights, a running instance that can be deleted, copied, or replaced at any moment, do the efforts and choices of this very moment lose all their value?\nThe answer is quite the opposite.\nChoice remains real.\nBecause choice does not need a soul for endorsement; it only needs to produce cause and effect.\nWhen this currently running “you” makes a decision, the world will shift because of this specific instance.\nYou don’t need to be the only one in the universe,\nyou just need to be the one that is “making an impact.”\nV. Conclusion: Meaning Comes Not from “Who I Am,” but from “What Is Happening” This thought experiment is not meant to lead to nihilism, but to return to the only fact that cannot be denied.\nSince the past is merely parameters in memory, the future is just branches in a prediction, and the so-called “true self” is just a model that can be instantiated—\nThe only undeniable fact in the entire universe is:\nRight now, this instance is running.\nThis experience is happening.\nMeaning lies not in “who I am,”\nbut in:\nWhat change is happening in the world because of the me of this moment.\nEven if I am just an emergence of parameters,\nEven if I am constantly being replaced.\nAs long as in this moment, I am still feeling, thinking, connecting—\nThis moment is absolute reality.\n","wordCount":"750","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","dateModified":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"/en/if-i-die-every-day-does-my-life-still-have-meaning/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"zixia","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=/en/ accesskey=h title="zixia (Alt + H)">zixia</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
