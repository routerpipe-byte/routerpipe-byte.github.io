Study Method for the Theory Test

It is highly inadvisable to just cram practice questions because:

The question bank is huge. The English test has over 200 sets, each with 30 questions, totaling more than 6,000 questions. Finishing them all is time-consuming and exhausting.
The translations and questions in the bank may not be accurate, and the answers could be wrong.
The actual exam questions are not directly from the question bank, so finishing it is not very helpful.
The knowledge in the question bank is fragmented and not systematic. Without systematic learning, you might not be able to answer if the question is phrased differently.


Efficient Study Method: Since I took the exam in English, the following content is based on English materials."><meta name=author content><link rel=canonical href=/en/ru-he-gao-xiao-zi-xue-kuai-su-tong-guo-xi-ban-ya-qi-che-jia-shi-zhi-zhao-b-de-li-lun-kao-shi/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.da3211e5ef867bf2b75fd5a6515cfed7195c011e8ab735694e203810a827097b.css integrity="sha256-2jIR5e+Ge/K3X9WmUVz+1xlcAR6KtzVpTiA4EKgnCXs=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=zh href=/zh/ru-he-gao-xiao-zi-xue-kuai-su-tong-guo-xi-ban-ya-qi-che-jia-shi-zhi-zhao-b-de-li-lun-kao-shi/><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=/en/ru-he-gao-xiao-zi-xue-kuai-su-tong-guo-xi-ban-ya-qi-che-jia-shi-zhi-zhao-b-de-li-lun-kao-shi/><link rel=alternate hreflang=es href=/es/ru-he-gao-xiao-zi-xue-kuai-su-tong-guo-xi-ban-ya-qi-che-jia-shi-zhi-zhao-b-de-li-lun-kao-shi/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51);color-scheme:dark}.list{background:var(--theme)}.toc{background:var(--entry)}}@media(prefers-color-scheme:light){.list::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--code-bg)}}</style></noscript><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="dark":localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="light":window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches?document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="dark":document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="light"</script><script>(function(){var t,n,s,o="pref-theme",e=localStorage.getItem(o);if(e==="dark"||e==="light"){document.documentElement.classList.toggle("dark",e==="dark");return}t=(new Date).getHours(),n=t>=19||t<7,s=n,document.documentElement.classList.toggle("dark",s)})()</script><script>(function(){function e(e){localStorage.setItem("pref-theme",e),document.documentElement.classList.toggle("dark",e==="dark")}document.addEventListener("click",function(t){var n=t.target,s=n&&(n.id==="moon"?n:n.closest&&n.closest("#moon")),o=n&&(n.id==="sun"?n:n.closest&&n.closest("#sun"));s&&e("dark"),o&&e("light")})})()</script><meta property="og:url" content="/en/ru-he-gao-xiao-zi-xue-kuai-su-tong-guo-xi-ban-ya-qi-che-jia-shi-zhi-zhao-b-de-li-lun-kao-shi/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="zixia"><meta property="og:title" content="How to Self-Study Efficiently and Quickly Pass the Spanish B Driving License Theory Test"><meta property="og:description" content="I.

The knowledge in the question bank is fragmented and not systematic. Without systematic learning, you might not be able to answer if the question is phrased differently. Efficient Study Method: Since I took the exam in English, the following content is based on English materials.\nFirst, study the condensed content from the textbook: https://practicatest.com/en/book-theory-driving-test. The knowledge points on this webpage are very concise, and you can review them all in about 4 hours. However, it lacks content on new energy vehicles, environmental labels, motorcycle electronic helmets, and electric scooters, which you need to learn from the textbook materials. Complete Theory Textbook: Most textbooks are over 200 pages long, with a lot of content, making them time-consuming and tiring to study. It’s recommended to supplement your learning by focusing on your weak areas while doing practice questions. If you have time, you can briefly browse the entire textbook. Digital versions of the English textbook are circulated privately, but due to copyright issues, I can only provide keywords for you to search on your own. You can also buy a physical copy on Amazon. Keywords: “Manual Permiso B inglés”. Online digital English textbook: https://fliphtml5.com/lptj/szub/basic/51-100 Popular Question Banks Practicatest, AEOL, and Todotest are available options, all of which can be purchased online. Taking AEOL as an example: Purchase link: https://www.autoescueladummy.com/product-page/plan-premium Online question bank link: https://cloud.aeolservice.es/ It costs €10 per month. You need to enter your NIE number to bind your account when purchasing. If you need to renew after it expires, you can purchase it again and enter the same NIE number to renew the account. AEOL Question Bank Usage Suggestions: Choose the 744 question bank and start from the last few sets of questions. The question bank is not randomly arranged; the earlier ones are old content, while the newer topics are in the later sets. The latest exam topics (such as car environmental labels, motorcycle electronic helmets, new energy vehicles, electric scooters, etc.) may only appear in the last few new test papers. Older textbooks may also not cover these topics, so supplementary study is needed. Practice Question Tips: You don’t have to complete all the questions in the bank because there are too many, and the actual exam questions are not identical to the bank. In the actual exam, there are 30 questions to be completed in 30 minutes, and you are allowed a maximum of 3 mistakes. When your practice test accuracy reaches over 90%, your chances of passing the exam are very high. The AEOL question bank records your incorrect answers. Use the incorrect answer test feature to review and consolidate before the exam. DGT Free Mock Tests: The DGT official website provides 3 free English mock tests that you can use for practice: https://sedeapl.dgt.gob.es:7443/WEB_AUTO-6/examen/Instrucciones.jsf\nII. Self-Service Online Registration Booking an Appointment for the Theory Test Book an appointment on the official website: https://sede.dgt.gob.es/es/otros-tramites/cita-previa-jefaturas/index.shtml Click on “Solicitud de cita previa” and follow the instructions to book. Note: This is to book an appointment to go to the DGT office to apply for the exam, not to book the exam time directly. Don’t worry if there are no available slots. They usually release new slots at 2 PM on weekdays. You will definitely get an appointment if you check for a few days. Driving Test Medical Examination: List of medical centers: https://www.dgt.es/conoce-la-dgt/con-quien-trabajamos/centros-reconocimiento-conductores/ Just choose the one closest to you. Medical Exam Content: Inquiry about medical history; Concentration test (includes mini-games): A ball passes through an opaque box. You need to judge the time it takes for the ball to pass through the box based on its speed and the distance on both sides of the box, then press the pause button; control two small cars with your left and right hands respectively, driving on two different tracks, avoiding hitting the edges of the tracks; Vision test. Note: After the medical exam, check the information on the report (NIE number, name, date of birth, address, phone number, date of the exam, etc.). The medical report is valid for 3 months, so be sure to check the date. The fee is around €30. You need to bring your NIE card. Exam Fee Payment: Payment website: https://sede.dgt.gob.es/es/otros-tramites/compra-y-actualizacion-de-tasas/ You can also directly access the payment form: https://sedeclave.dgt.gob.es/WEB_Tasas7/jsp/tasas/generarPresupuesto.jspx On the form, select “791-2.1”. Fill in the information as prompted and submit. Payment method: You can choose to pay online or in cash at a bank. Remember to print or save the receipt after payment. Online payment is supported by major Spanish local banks like BBVA, Caixa, etc. https://sede.agenciatributaria.gob.es/Sede/deudas-apremios-embargos-subastas/pagar-aplazar-consultar/listado-entidades-bancarias-adheridas.html?faqId=3a96573ba13d2710VgnVCM100000dc381e0aRCRD The fee for 2024 is €94.05. This fee covers two exam attempts. If you fail the first time, you can go to the office again to book a second exam time. If you fail both times, you will need to pay the fee again. On-site Material Preparation for Booking the Exam Time: Go to the DGT office at your scheduled appointment time. Enter your NIE number at the ticket machine to get a number. Submit the following documents to book your exam time on-site.\nAppointment confirmation (printed or saved on your phone). NIE card (must be valid). Application form “Solicitud de pruebas de aptitude” (make sure to fill in the correct exam language, otherwise you might get a Spanish paper instead of an English one). https://sede.dgt.gob.es/export/sites/dgt/.galleries/modelos-solicitud/04/Mod.04-ES.pdf Medical report (within 3 months). Certificate of residence (empadronamiento) (within 3 months, can be printed from your local city hall’s website using a digital certificate, e.g., for Rocafort, it’s the Rocafort city hall, not the Valencia city hall). Passport-sized photo with a white background (32x26mm, 1 piece, not always required). Payment form “791-2.1” and the payment receipt. III. On the Day of the Exam It is recommended to arrive at the test center half an hour early, bringing your NIE card and all registration materials. An examiner will call out names at the entrance of the examination room. You will enter the room in order. The exam is computer-based: Enter your NIE number to log into the exam system. The exam duration is 30 minutes, with a total of 30 questions. IV. Checking the Theory Test Results Query via Mobile App: Use the miDGT mobile app to check. Log in by binding your digital certificate (the one used on your computer can be imported to your phone). The results are usually available about 1 hour after the exam. Query on the Official Website: Results are generally available after 10 hours. Results query page: https://sedeclave.dgt.gob.es/WEB_NOTP_CONSULTA/consultaNota.faces Finally, good luck, and I hope you pass the Spanish B driving license theory test soon. Note that you must pass the practical test within 3 years, or the theory test result will expire.\n","wordCount":"1188","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","dateModified":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"/en/ru-he-gao-xiao-zi-xue-kuai-su-tong-guo-xi-ban-ya-qi-che-jia-shi-zhi-zhao-b-de-li-lun-kao-shi/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"zixia","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=/en/ accesskey=h title="zixia (Alt + H)">zixia</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
