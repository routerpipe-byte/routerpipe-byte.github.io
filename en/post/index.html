  "title": "My Experience Passing the Spanish Driving Test",
  "body": "I passed my driving test, and I&#39;m sharing my experience.\n\nDuring the driving test in Spain, the examiner will only give instructions in Spanish, and the instructor is generally not allowed to translate. Therefore, it is crucial to master the following common commands and their Spanish expressions:\n\n*   **Start the engine**: Arrancar\n*   **Turn right**: Derecha\n*   **Turn left**: Izquierda\n*   **Go straight**: Recto\n*   **Make a U-turn**: Cambio de sentido\n*   **Indirect left turn**: izquierda indirecto\n*   **Roundabout**: Rotonda\n*   **First exit**: Primera salida\n*   **Second exit**: Segunda salida\n*   **Third exit**: Tercera salida\n*   **Fourth exit**: Cuarta salida\n*   **Stop**: Parar\n*   **Park**: Aparcar\n\nIf you don&#39;t hear an instruction clearly, you can ask the examiner to repeat it in Spanish, for example: “Por favor repita”.\n\n### **Pay Attention to Deviations in Examiner Instructions**\n\nSometimes the examiner might give an incorrect instruction, either intentionally or unintentionally. For example, if instructed to turn right, but there is a traffic sign at the intersection or on the road prohibiting a right turn, you should ignore the instruction and continue to follow the road signs.\n\nAt the same time, you should maintain a wide field of vision while driving and be aware that road markings are often about 30 meters before an intersection, while there may be no corresponding signs at the intersection itself. There are also vertical signs and traffic lights, with traffic lights having the highest priority. If there is a vertical STOP sign at an intersection but also a green light, you must strictly follow the higher-priority traffic light and not stop.\n\n### **Understanding Roundabout Rules**\n\n*   **Urban roundabouts:**\n    *   For left turns and U-turns, you must use the inner lane.\n    *   When the inner lane has traffic lights, you can proceed directly on a green light. A flashing yellow light means you must yield to traffic from the right. Be sure to look to your right; you should yield to cars that are 25 meters away because they are moving fast.\n    *   For right turns and going straight, you should choose the outer lane.\n\n*   **Roundabouts outside the city:**\n    *   Always use the outer lane, unless you are overtaking, in which case you can use the inner lane.\n\nWhen exiting a roundabout, be sure to signal right in advance and use your turn signal correctly to assist with lane changes. If traffic congestion prevents you from changing lanes to exit from the inner lane, you should continue to circle the roundabout until it is safe to change lanes, then switch to the rightmost lane (the further right, the better) to exit (in Spain, changing multiple lanes consecutively is permitted). For complex roundabouts divided into several islands, when making a circuitous left turn, enter from the rightmost lane. For going straight, you should choose the middle or leftmost lane. The keyword is *indirecto*.\n\n### **Lane Selection and Intersection Driving**\n\n*   **When going straight:**\n    *   If there are three lanes, you should generally choose the first lane from the right;\n    *   If there are more than three lanes, it is recommended to use the second lane.\n\n*   **When passing through intersections:**\n    *   Avoid stopping on pedestrian crossings, bike lanes, or other special lanes, especially in congested areas marked with a yellow cross-hatch.\n    *   If the vehicle ahead stops due to lack of space, you should stop early and wait, ensuring your stopping position does not obstruct these special lanes.\n\n### **Safe Driving and Right-of-Way Awareness**\n\nSpanish traffic laws are very strict about right-of-way. People have a strong sense of right-of-way. At crosswalks without traffic lights, pedestrians have absolute priority. They are not in the habit of looking left and right for traffic and may cross suddenly. Therefore, when driving in areas where you do not have the right-of-way, you must remain highly alert, especially in sections with yield signs. You need to check for approaching traffic in bike lanes or vehicle lanes behind you and turn your head to confirm the situation.\n\nHowever, when you have a green light, even if there are pedestrians on the crosswalk, you must not slow down or stop in advance, unless there is an unavoidable emergency, in which case only emergency braking is permitted. When approaching a crosswalk without traffic lights, you should slow down appropriately. If there are signs indicating students or children, you also need to perform a braking action to reduce speed.\n\nGenerally, the speed limit on urban roads is 50 km/h, while single-lane roads may be limited to 30 or 20 km/h. Roads outside the city are typically 90 km/h, and highways are 120 km/h. You are generally expected to drive as close to the maximum speed limit as possible; even exceeding it by 2-5 km/h is acceptable.\n\n### **STOP Signs and Temporary Stopping Requirements**\n\nWhen you encounter a STOP line on the road, you must stop before the line and wait for 3 seconds. Then, after moving about 1-2 meters past the line, you must stop again to observe the traffic conditions. This double stop is a test requirement. If visibility is poor, you should stop multiple times to ensure it is safe.\n\nHowever, note that if there is also a traffic light, you must strictly follow the light&#39;s signal. You are not allowed to stop on a green light and must proceed directly; stopping in this case will result in a penalty. If there is no stop line, you should position your car about one meter into the intersection, stop for at least 3 seconds, confirm it is safe, and then proceed.\n\n### **Driving Test Procedure and Strategy**\n\nThe driving test usually begins with 3-5 minutes of independent driving, after which the examiner will give instructions based on the situation. Since you may not be familiar with many of the routes on your first drive, it is advisable to observe distant road signs in advance. For example, entering a roundabout might require you to be in the left lane, while the right lane is for other directions; there are usually traffic signs above the intersection to indicate this. Sometimes, a left turn is not necessarily made from the left lane but may need to be completed from the right lane. In such cases, you must observe the road markings or overhead signs ahead of time and prepare to change lanes. If it&#39;s too late to change lanes, it is better to disobey the examiner&#39;s instruction than to force a lane change.\n\nIf road markings are difficult to see because they are blocked by a large vehicle or are faded, and there are no clear directional or prohibitive signs at the intersection, you can watch for hand signals from your instructor. When in doubt, it is advisable to choose to turn right and try to avoid turning left.\n\n

You are not allowed to stop on a green light and must proceed directly; stopping in this case will result in a penalty. If there is no stop line, you should position your car about one meter into the intersection, stop for at least 3 seconds, confirm it is safe, and then proceed.\\n\\n### **Driving Test Procedure and Strategy**\\n\\nThe driving test usually begins with 3-5 minutes of independent driving, after which the examiner will give instructions based on the situation. Since you may not be familiar with many of the routes on your first drive, it is advisable to observe distant road signs in advance. For example, entering a roundabout might require you to be in the left lane, while the right lane is for other directions; there are usually traffic signs above the intersection to indicate this. Sometimes, a left turn is not necessarily made from the left lane but may need to be completed from the right lane. In such cases, you must observe the road markings or overhead signs ahead of time and prepare to change lanes. If it\u0026#39;s too late to change lanes, it is better to disobey the examiner\u0026#39;s instruction than to force a lane change.\\n\\nIf road markings are difficult to see because they are blocked by a large vehicle or are faded, and there are no clear directional or prohibitive signs at the intersection, you can watch for hand signals from your instructor. When in doubt, it is advisable to choose to turn right and try to avoid turning left.\\n\\n ![](/images/wechat/b8469f50e5d2.jpg) \\n\\n\u0026gt; The overhead road sign indicates entering the roundabout from the left lane.\\n\\n ![](/images/wechat/e13d835e1a4d.jpg) \\n\\n\u0026gt; Prioritize the traffic light on the right; do not stop at a green light.\\n\\n ![](/images/wechat/35d3cf03f638.jpg) \\n\\n\u0026gt; The road markings indicate a right turn only, but there is no sign at the intersection prohibiting a left turn.

Therefore, it is crucial to master the following common commands and their Spanish expressions:\\n\\n* **Start the engine**: Arrancar\\n* **Turn right**: Derecha\\n* **Turn left**: Izquierda\\n* **Go straight**: Recto\\n* **Make a U-turn**: Cambio de sentido\\n* **Indirect left turn**: izquierda indirecto\\n* **Roundabout**: Rotonda\\n* **First exit**: Primera salida\\n* **Second exit**: Segunda salida\\n* **Third exit**: Tercera salida\\n* **Fourth exit**: Cuarta salida\\n* **Stop**: Parar\\n* **Park**: Aparcar\\n\\nIf you don't hear an instruction clearly, you can ask the examiner to repeat it in Spanish, for example: “Por favor repita”.\\n\\n### **Pay Attention to Deviations in Examiner Instructions**\\n\\nSometimes the examiner might give an incorrect instruction, either intentionally or unintentionally. For example, if instructed to turn right, but there is a traffic sign at the intersection or on the road prohibiting a right turn, you should ignore the instruction and continue to follow the road signs.\\n\\nAt the same time, you should maintain a wide field of vision while driving and be aware that road markings are often about 30 meters before an intersection, while there may be no corresponding signs at the intersection itself. There are also vertical signs and traffic lights, with traffic lights having the highest priority. If there is a vertical STOP sign at an intersection but also a green light, you must strictly follow the higher-priority traffic light and not stop.\\n\\n### **Understanding Roundabout Rules**\\n\\n* **Urban roundabouts:**\\n * For left turns and U-turns, you must use the inner lane.\\n * When the inner lane has traffic lights, you can proceed directly on a green light. A flashing yellow light means you must yield to traffic from the right. Be sure to look to your right; you should yield to cars that are 25 meters away because they are moving fast.\\n * For right turns and going straight, you should choose the outer lane.\\n\\n* **Roundabouts outside the city:**\\n * Always use the outer lane, unless you are overtaking, in which case you can use the inner lane.\\n\\nWhen exiting a roundabout, be sure to signal right in advance and use your turn signal correctly to assist with lane changes. If traffic congestion prevents you from changing lanes to exit from the inner lane, you should continue to circle the roundabout until it is safe to change lanes, then switch to the rightmost lane (the further right, the better) to exit (in Spain, changing multiple lanes consecutively is permitted). For complex roundabouts divided into several islands, when making a circuitous left turn, enter from the rightmost lane. For going straight, you should choose the middle or leftmost lane. The keyword is *indirecto*.\\n\\n### **Lane Selection and Intersection Driving**\\n\\n* **When going straight:**\\n * If there are three lanes, you should generally choose the first lane from the right;\\n * If there are more than three lanes, it is recommended to use the second lane.\\n\\n* **When passing through intersections:**\\n * Avoid stopping on pedestrian crossings, bike lanes, or other special lanes, especially in congested areas marked with a yellow cross-hatch.\\n * If the vehicle ahead stops due to lack of space, you should stop early and wait, ensuring your stopping position does not obstruct these special lanes.\\n\\n### **Safe Driving and Right-of-Way Awareness**\\n\\nSpanish traffic laws are very strict about right-of-way. People have a strong sense of right-of-way. At crosswalks without traffic lights, pedestrians have absolute priority. They are not in the habit of looking left and right for traffic and may cross suddenly. Therefore, when driving in areas where you do not have the right-of-way, you must remain highly alert, especially in sections with yield signs. You need to check for approaching traffic in bike lanes or vehicle lanes behind you and turn your head to confirm the situation.\\n\\nHowever, when you have a green light, even if there are pedestrians on the crosswalk, you must not slow down or stop in advance, unless there is an unavoidable emergency, in which case only emergency braking is permitted. When approaching a crosswalk without traffic lights, you should slow down appropriately. If there are signs indicating students or children, you also need to perform a braking action to reduce speed.\\n\\nGenerally, the speed limit on urban roads is 50 km/h, while single-lane roads may be limited to 30 or 20 km/h. Roads outside the city are typically 90 km/h, and highways are 120 km/h. You are generally expected to drive as close to the maximum speed limit as possible; even exceeding it by 2-5 km/h is acceptable.\\n\\n### **STOP Signs and Temporary Stopping Requirements**\\n\\nWhen you encounter a STOP line on the road, you must stop before the line and wait for 3 seconds. Then, after moving about 1-2 meters past the line, you must stop again to observe the traffic conditions. This double stop is a test requirement. If visibility is poor, you should stop multiple times to ensure it is safe.\\n\\nHowever, note that if there is also a traffic light, you must strictly follow the light's signal. You are not allowed to stop on a green light and must proceed directly; stopping in this case will result in a penalty. If there is no stop line, you should position your car about one meter into the intersection, stop for at least 3 seconds, confirm it is safe, and then proceed.\\n\\n### **Driving Test Procedure and Strategy**\\n\\nThe driving test usually begins with 3-5 minutes of independent driving, after which the examiner will give instructions based on the situation.
