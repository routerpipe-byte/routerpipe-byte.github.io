  "body": "In Spain, commercial parking lots are generally expensive. A few hours can easily cost tens of euros, which is a significant expense. To save money, consider using free roadside parking spots or the blue-line paid parking spaces provided by the municipality.\n\nBlue-line parking spaces are cheaper, costing around €1 per hour, but manual payment is quite cumbersome. You need to go to a nearby payment machine, enter your license plate number and parking duration, and pay with coins or a card. If you leave early, the refund process is also quite troublesome. Therefore, it&#39;s highly recommended to use convenient parking payment apps for online payment and flexible billing, which is more economical and practical.\n\nAdditionally, taxi fares to Spanish airports are high. Traveling from a smaller city to Madrid&#39;s airport by train or bus can be troublesome and time-consuming. It would be much more convenient to park your own car near the airport and drive home directly upon your return. However, official airport parking is expensive, and long-term parking fees can be a major expense. So, how can you save money? In fact, there are specialized long-term parking lots near Spanish airports, with costs around €4 per day. This option is the most cost-effective for those traveling in groups.\n\n## I.
