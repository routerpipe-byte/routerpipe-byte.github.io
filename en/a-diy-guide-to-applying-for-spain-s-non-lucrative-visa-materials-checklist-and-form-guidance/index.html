Extremely Low Application Threshold  \n    The overall difficulty is comparable to an individual applying for a standard tourist visa. You only need to provide stable financial proof demonstrating that the applicant and their family can afford to live in Spain long-term without working.\n\n2.  Relatively Short Approval Period  \n    You can typically get a result within 1–3 months after submitting a complete application, which is more efficient than other long-term European residency programs.\n\n3.  Extremely Low DIY Cost  \n    The entire process can be handled by yourself, achieving virtually "zero agency fees." You only need to cover necessary costs like translation and notarization, avoiding exorbitant fees from agencies.\n\n4.  High-Quality Social Environment  \n    Spain is a developed European country with a comprehensive social security system:  \n    - Universal free healthcare  \n    - Free public education (university tuition is extremely low)  \n    - Free public transportation for specific groups in some cities  \n    - Social stability and a pace of life suitable for long-term family residence\n\n5.  Quickly Obtain a Second Identity  \n    Upon arrival in Spain, you can apply for a NIE (Foreigner&rsquo;s Identity Number), which has a wide range of uses:  \n    - Opening a bank account  \n    - Booking flights and checking into hotels  \n    - Registering a company, signing contracts  \n    - Functionally very similar to an EU ID card (with some exceptions for benefits)\n\n&mdash;\n\n## Rational Advice on the Investor Visa\n\nIt is strongly advised not to blindly opt for the former €500,000 Investor Visa (this policy has been canceled).  \nMany Chinese applicants, unfamiliar with the local market, were misled by agents into buying overpriced properties:  \n- A property quoted at €500,000 by an agent might have a real market value of only €200,000.  \n- In Spain, properties with "tens of thousands of square meters of land + a thousand square meters of building" are widely available for under €400,000.\n\nA more prudent path is:  \n> First, land in Spain with a non-lucrative visa → familiarize yourself with the market before considering buying property → switch to an investor-type residency if needed.\n\nTo avoid pitfalls when buying property, you can refer to:  \nA Complete Guide to Buying a Second-Hand Home in Spain\n  \n&mdash;\n\n## Costs and Long-Term Planning\n\n- Total costs for translation, notarization, travel, etc.: A few thousand RMB  \n- Maximum time allowed out of the country within 5 years: 10 months  \n- Must reside in Spain for no less than 183 days in a single year  \n- After 5 years: Can apply for Spanish or EU permanent residency  \n- After obtaining permanent residency: Entering the country once a year is sufficient  \n- After 10 years + passing a basic Spanish language test: Can apply for Spanish citizenship\n\nOfficial policy explanation (Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs):  \nhttps://www.exteriores.gob.es/Consulados/pekin/zh/ServiciosConsulares/Paginas/Consular/Visado-de-residencia-no-lucrativa.aspx\n\n> Note: The above is the general legal framework. Individual consulates may have slight variations in their actual review process.\n\n&mdash;\n\n## Choosing the Right Consulate for Submission\n\nThe main applicant must choose the consulate based on their place of household registration (hukou); those already overseas can apply at the local Spanish consulate:\n\n- Consulate in Chengdu (newly established in 2023): Sichuan Province  \n- Consulate General in Shanghai: Shanghai, Anhui, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Zhejiang  \n- Consulate General in Guangzhou: Fujian, Guangdong, Guizhou, Hainan, Hunan, Yunnan, Guangxi  \n- Consulate General in Beijing: Covers the widest range, including many northern and western provinces and cities\n\n> Experience: The Beijing consular district has relatively simpler requirements, while the Shanghai district is the strictest with materials.\n\nPlease use Spanish or English for inquiries:\n\n- Beijing: cog.pekin@maec.es  \n- Guangzhou: cog.canton@maec.es  \n- Hong Kong: cog.hongkong@maec.es  \n- Shanghai: Cg.Shanghai@maec.es\n\n&mdash;\n\n## Practical Tips\n\nDriver&rsquo;s License Issue  \n- The Spanish driving test is extremely difficult, and Chinese licenses cannot be exchanged for Spanish ones.  \n- An Ecuadorian driver&rsquo;s license can be exchanged for a Spanish one.  \n- Recommendation: First, obtain an exchangeable license → then enter Spain.\n\nTranslation and Notarization  \n- All documents must be translated into Spanish.  \n- You can get translation + notarization + Hague apostille done on Taobao.  \n- The criminal record check can be processed online.\n\n&mdash;\n\n## Financial Requirements (Key)\n\nThe financial standard is based on the IPREM:\n\n- Initial application: Main applicant 4 times the IPREM  \n- For each additional family member: +1 time the IPREM  \n- Renewal: Main applicant 8 times the IPREM, family members +2 times  \n- 2025 IPREM: €7,200\n\n> Proof of funds from either domestic or foreign banks is acceptable.\n\n&mdash;\n\n## Form Downloads\n\n- National Visa Application Form (Chinese version)  \n  https://www.exteriores.gob.es/Consulados/canton/es/ServiciosConsulares/Documents/nacional-es-cn.pdf\n\n

Choose the Spanish Non-Lucrative Visa?\n\n<strong>Core Advantages:</strong>\n\n1. <strong>Extremely Low Application Threshold</strong> \n The overall difficulty is comparable to an individual applying for a standard tourist visa. You only need to provide stable financial proof demonstrating that the applicant and their family can afford to live in Spain long-term without working.\n\n2. <strong>Relatively Short Approval Period</strong> \n You can typically get a result within <strong>1–3 months</strong> after submitting a complete application, which is more efficient than other long-term European residency programs.\n\n3. <strong>Extremely Low DIY Cost</strong> \n The entire process can be handled by yourself, achieving virtually "zero agency fees." You only need to cover necessary costs like translation and notarization, avoiding exorbitant fees from agencies.\n\n4. <strong>High-Quality Social Environment</strong> \n Spain is a developed European country with a comprehensive social security system: \n - Universal free healthcare \n - Free public education (university tuition is extremely low) \n - Free public transportation for specific groups in some cities \n - Social stability and a pace of life suitable for long-term family residence\n\n5. <strong>Quickly Obtain a Second Identity</strong> \n Upon arrival in Spain, you can apply for a <strong>NIE (Foreigner&rsquo;s Identity Number)</strong>, which has a wide range of uses: \n - Opening a bank account \n - Booking flights and checking into hotels \n - Registering a company, signing contracts \n - Functionally very similar to an EU ID card (with some exceptions for benefits)\n\n&mdash;\n\n## Rational Advice on the Investor Visa\n\nIt is strongly advised not to blindly opt for the former <strong>€500,000 Investor Visa</strong> (this policy has been canceled). \nMany Chinese applicants, unfamiliar with the local market, were misled by agents into buying overpriced properties: \n- A property quoted at €500,000 by an agent might have a real market value of only €200,000. \n- In Spain, properties with "tens of thousands of square meters of land + a thousand square meters of building" are widely available for under €400,000.\n\nA more prudent path is: \n> First, land in Spain with a non-lucrative visa → familiarize yourself with the market before considering buying property → switch to an investor-type residency if needed.\n\nTo avoid pitfalls when buying property, you can refer to: \n<a href=/en/a-complete-guide-to-buying-second-hand-property-in-spain-using-idealista-for-cadastral-checks-nota-simple-and-avoiding-pitfalls-in-notarization-and-transfer/>A Complete Guide to Buying a Second-Hand Home in Spain</a>\n \n&mdash;\n\n## Costs and Long-Term Planning\n\n- Total costs for translation, notarization, travel, etc.: <strong>A few thousand RMB</strong> \n- Maximum time allowed out of the country within 5 years: <strong>10 months</strong> \n- Must reside in Spain for no less than 183 days in a single year \n- After 5 years: Can apply for Spanish or EU permanent residency \n- After obtaining permanent residency: Entering the country once a year is sufficient \n- After 10 years + passing a basic Spanish language test: Can apply for <strong>Spanish citizenship</strong>\n\nOfficial policy explanation (Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs): \nhttps://www.exteriores.gob.es/Consulados/pekin/zh/ServiciosConsulares/Paginas/Consular/Visado-de-residencia-no-lucrativa.aspx\n\n> Note: The above is the general legal framework. Individual consulates may have slight variations in their actual review process.\n\n&mdash;\n\n## Choosing the Right Consulate for Submission\n\nThe main applicant must choose the consulate based on their <strong>place of household registration (hukou)</strong>; those already overseas can apply at the local Spanish consulate:\n\n- <strong>Consulate in Chengdu (newly established in 2023)</strong>: Sichuan Province \n- <strong>Consulate General in Shanghai</strong>: Shanghai, Anhui, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Zhejiang \n- <strong>Consulate General in Guangzhou</strong>: Fujian, Guangdong, Guizhou, Hainan, Hunan, Yunnan, Guangxi \n- <strong>Consulate General in Beijing</strong>: Covers the widest range, including many northern and western provinces and cities\n\n> Experience: The Beijing consular district has relatively simpler requirements, while the Shanghai district is the strictest with materials.\n\nPlease use <strong>Spanish or English</strong> for inquiries:\n\n- Beijing: <a href=mailto:cog.pekin@maec.es>cog.pekin@maec.es</a> \n- Guangzhou: <a href=mailto:cog.canton@maec.es>cog.canton@maec.es</a> \n- Hong Kong: <a href=mailto:cog.hongkong@maec.es>cog.hongkong@maec.es</a> \n- Shanghai: <a href=mailto:Cg.Shanghai@maec.es>Cg.Shanghai@maec.es</a>\n\n&mdash;\n\n## Practical Tips\n\n<strong>Driver&rsquo;s License Issue</strong> \n- The Spanish driving test is extremely difficult, and Chinese licenses <strong>cannot be exchanged</strong> for Spanish ones. \n- An Ecuadorian driver&rsquo;s license can be exchanged for a Spanish one. \n- Recommendation: First, obtain an exchangeable license → then enter Spain.\n\n<strong>Translation and Notarization</strong> \n- All documents must be translated into Spanish. \n- You can get translation + notarization + Hague apostille done on Taobao. \n- The criminal record check can be processed online.\n\n&mdash;\n\n## Financial Requirements (Key)\n\nThe financial standard is based on the <strong>IPREM</strong>:\n\n- Initial application: Main applicant <strong>4 times the IPREM</strong> \n- For each additional family member: +1 time the IPREM \n- Renewal: Main applicant <strong>8 times the IPREM</strong>, family members +2 times \n- 2025 IPREM: <strong>€7,200</strong>\n\n> Proof of funds from either domestic or foreign banks is acceptable.\n\n&mdash;\n\n## Form Downloads\n\n- National Visa Application Form
