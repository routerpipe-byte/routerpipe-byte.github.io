The “Rear-View Mirror” Illusion of History Many Chinese people today have an almost unconscious, subconscious belief: the West seems inherently more advanced than China.\nBut this is a typical historical illusion, ‘reverse-engineered’ by the outcome of the Industrial Revolution.\nWe are used to looking back from the pinnacle of modern civilization, thus applying a filter of ’the West was destined to lead’ to history.\nIn fact, if we view human civilization as a marathon, China was the front-runner, far ahead, for most of the race.\nIt wasn’t until after the start of the Age of Discovery in the 15th century that the scales truly began to tip.\nFor the sake of comparison, let’s set our coordinates to the year 1100 AD—the mid-to-late period of the Northern Song Dynasty.\nYou will find that in terms of:\nUrban scale Institutional efficiency Financial system And even the freedom of ordinary people On these hard metrics, the Song Dynasty of that era was like an ‘overwhelmingly advanced force’ from the future.\nWe misjudge history because we look back at the process from the standpoint of the outcome.\nII. Cities: Commercial Civilization vs. War Fortresses Want to understand the cities of the Song Dynasty? You don’t need tedious data, just look at one painting: Along the River During the Qingming Festival.\nThe protagonists of this painting are not emperors or myths, but:\nBustling merchants Resting citizens Busy boatmen on the Bian River Rows of taverns and pharmacies This isn’t just ’lively’; it’s a highly mature urban economic structure.\nA Quick Comparison Bianliang of the Northern Song vs. Contemporary Europe (e.g., Paris / London)\nDimension Bianliang of the Northern Song (Kaifeng) Contemporary Europe (e.g., Paris) Population Scale 1 million+ (the world’s first 24-hour city) Only a few thousand to tens of thousands Lifestyle Curfews completely abolished, night markets ran all night Gates shut tight, silent after dark Core Function Commercial, consumption, and social center Refuge, defensive fortification, node of power In a nutshell:\nThe cities of the Song Dynasty were ’living societies,’ while European cities were merely ‘components of a feudal lord’s domain.’\nIII. Institutions: A Mature State Apparatus vs. A Fragmented Feudal Puzzle In 1100, the Song Dynasty operated a centralized system far ahead of its time.\nCivilian Governance: Officials were centrally appointed, assessed, and rotated, essentially eliminating local hereditary fiefdoms.\nA Unified National Strategy: A unified tax system, laws, and household registration allowed for the efficient cross-regional allocation of finances and grain.\nContemporary Europe, on the other hand, was more like a fragmented ‘jigsaw puzzle’:\nThe king was often just the ‘greatest lord’ Power was carved up by the nobility and the Church Peasants directly faced fierce private lords not the law of the state While the Song Dynasty governed by institutions, Europe was still propped up by bloodlines and feudal contracts.\nEurope did not begin to truly form nation-states until the 18th century.\nWhether a country can function in the long term depends on whether it relies on institutions or on bloodlines.\nIV. Talent: The Imperial Examination System vs. Bloodline Theory (The Truth of Social Mobility) This is the most ‘modern-feeling’ component of China’s ancient system: the imperial examination system.\nIn China in 1100, a poor scholar from a remote village could, through study and examination, eventually enter the core of power in Kaifeng.\nThis logic of ‘fair competition and merit-based selection’ broke the monopoly of bloodlines on power.\nIn contrast to contemporary Europe: An extremely rigid system of hereditary aristocracy was practiced.\nEurope: If you were born a peasant, you remained a peasant for life. The path to advancement was locked by bloodline, leaving the talented lower classes with no hope.\nChina: “A farmer’s son in the morning, in the emperor’s court by evening.” The examination system provided continuous social mobility, absorbing the brightest minds from the populace into the state’s administration.\nWhile the Song Dynasty governed with ‘brainpower,’ Europe was still relying on the ’lottery of birth’ to determine fate.\nV. Military: A “Great Power’s War Machine,” Not “Poor and Weak” For a long time, we have gravely misunderstood the military strength of the Song Dynasty.\nThe ‘weakness’ of the Song Dynasty was not because it wasn’t strong, but because it faced—the most brutal and sophisticated peak of nomadic military power in human history.\nOrganizational Power: The Northern Song had a standing army of 800,000 to 1.2 million, fully supported by the state treasury.\nLogistical System: A systematic supply of military rations, distribution of soldiers’ pay, and standardized weapon manufacturing.\nThis was already the prototype of a modern state’s war machine.\nIn contrast to contemporary Europe:\nThere was no national standing army at all The military core consisted of feudal knights A king had to ‘beg and plead’ to mobilize his lords for war Actual troop numbers were typically only a few thousand Although ancient China and Europe never fought directly, we can make an indirect comparison:\nThe Xiongnu, driven out by the Han Dynasty, became Europe’s nightmare (the Scourge of God) and shaped what would become Hungary. The Turks, repelled by the Tang Dynasty, were reborn in West Asia as the Ottoman Turks, who personally brought an end to the Eastern Roman Empire.\nWhat were ‘remnant forces’ to a Chinese dynasty were ‘Gods of War’ in Europe.\nVI. Well-being: Who Were the True “Free People”? This is the most perception-shattering point: the people of ancient China were likely much happier than medieval Europeans.\n① Fuller Pockets (Tax Burden) Song Dynasty: Mainly state taxes, with a typical rate of about 5%–10%, and a legally guaranteed mechanism for tax relief in disaster years.\nEurope: Triple exploitation, with a combined annual extraction rate as high as 25%–35%.\n② More Personal Freedom (Personal Rights) Song Dynasty: Legally, there were no serfs. Tenant farmers and landlords had an economic contractual relationship, and they could freely migrate and change professions.\nEurope: Serfdom was rampant. Serfs could not marry freely, could not leave the land, and were not considered people, but rather the ‘property’ of their lord.\nThe conflict in the Song Dynasty was the ‘gap between rich and poor’; the conflict in Europe was ‘personal bondage.’\nVII. The Turning Point: Why Did We “Lose” Later On? Since China had such an early and stable start, why did it fall behind later?\nThe true turning point in history was—on the high seas.\nZheng He vs. Columbus: Two Completely Different Logics Zheng He (An Imperial Project): Grand in scale, its core logic was ’to show off.’ The emperor paid for it for the prestige of having all nations pay homage.\nThe result: He brought back giraffes from distant Africa, brought back prestige, but could not bring back sustainable profits.\nWhen the emperor died, the system automatically shut down.\nEuropean Seafaring (Capitalist Expansion): Merchants paid, the state protected, and the core logic was ‘plunder and colonization.’\nThe result: Silver and slaves flowed endlessly into Europe, trade was monopolized by European states and capital, and the Industrial Revolution was thus ignited.\nIt wasn’t until the sturdy ships and powerful cannons of the Western powers battered down the gates of the Qing Dynasty that the Chinese suddenly discovered—the world had, unbeknownst to them, already completed an epoch-making leap.\nVIII. Deep Reflection: The Three “Golden Bands” That Constrained Us China’s eventual fall from the lead was, in the final analysis, due to systemic differences on three dimensions. The first two of these were pointed out by young Chinese intellectuals as early as the May Fourth Movement a century ago.\n① Technology, but a Lack of Scientific Thought (A Difference in Mindset) Ancient China had immense technological accumulation (like the Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art and the Four Great Inventions), but it always lacked a systematic scientific framework.\nDuring the Renaissance, Europe rediscovered the rational thought of ancient Greece. Historical article: Europe once ’lost’ an entire civilization—why did the rational knowledge of ancient Greece disappear in medieval Europe?\nThis formed:\nLogical deduction Mathematical expression A spirit of falsifiable experimentation Technology is the summary of experience; science is the explosion of logic.\n② Unitary Power vs. Checks and Balances (A Difference in Political Logic) Ancient China was a highly autocratic monarchy, with the pressure of decision-making concentrated on the emperor alone.\nThis is a ‘single point of failure’ system:\nIf the emperor is wise, the state prospers If the emperor is foolish, the entire system collapses Whereas Europe had a long tradition of republicanism and proto-parliaments. Historical article: Why did Europe move towards democracy?—The republican tradition was not an accidental historical choice.\nThough often chaotic, it established a self-correcting mechanism that did not depend on an enlightened ruler.\n③ The “Path Lock-in” of a Unified Empire vs. The “Evolution” of Multi-State Competition China’s geography is enclosed and easily unified. Coupled with a highly monolithic script and culture, it long lacked internal competitive pressure.\nA successful system would be endlessly replicated, eventually falling into the ‘dynastic cycle.’\nWhereas Europe:\nPeninsulas, islands, and seas fragmented the space Multiple states coexisted and competed with each other Failed systems were eliminated Successful innovations were imitated China won with stability, but in its stability, it lost the impetus for mutation;\nEurope lost with chaos, but in its chaos, it stumbled upon the gate to modernization.\nConclusion: Not Pride, Nor Inferiority, but Clarity Looking back at this history is not about indulging in past glories, nor is it about wallowing in self-pity, but about achieving clarity.\nModern China’s backwardness was not because we were ’never capable,’ but because during the critical window for a breakthrough, we were locked in by the very path that once made us proud.\nOnly by clearly seeing the path we came from can we find the right way forward.\n","wordCount":"1643","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","dateModified":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"/en/ancient-china-once-left-the-entirety-of-europe-in-its-dust/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"zixia","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=/en/ accesskey=h title="zixia (Alt + H)">zixia</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
