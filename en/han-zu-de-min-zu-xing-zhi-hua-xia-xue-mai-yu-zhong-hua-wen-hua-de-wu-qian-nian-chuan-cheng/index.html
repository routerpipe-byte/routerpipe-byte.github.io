As recorded in the Records of the Grand Historian and Discourses of the States:

The Yellow Emperor (Huangdi) defeated the Yan Emperor (Yandi) at the Battle of Banquan, causing the Yan tribe to submit to his rule.
He then defeated Chiyou at the Battle of Zhuolu, securing ultimate victory.

These are not merely legends but symbols of the integration of ancient tribes:

Yellow Emperor&rsquo;s group: Agricultural tribes of the Central Plains, with the surname Ji.
Yan Emperor&rsquo;s group: Tribes with the surname Jiang, related to the ancient Qiang people.
Chiyou&rsquo;s group: The Jiuli (Nine Li) tribes, ancestors of the southern Miao-Man peoples.

Ultimately, the people of the Yan Emperor and Chiyou were incorporated into the Yellow Emperor&rsquo;s tribe, forming the &ldquo;Huaxia.&rdquo;"><meta name=author content><link rel=canonical href=/en/han-zu-de-min-zu-xing-zhi-hua-xia-xue-mai-yu-zhong-hua-wen-hua-de-wu-qian-nian-chuan-cheng/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.da3211e5ef867bf2b75fd5a6515cfed7195c011e8ab735694e203810a827097b.css integrity="sha256-2jIR5e+Ge/K3X9WmUVz+1xlcAR6KtzVpTiA4EKgnCXs=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=zh href=/zh/han-zu-de-min-zu-xing-zhi-hua-xia-xue-mai-yu-zhong-hua-wen-hua-de-wu-qian-nian-chuan-cheng/><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=/en/han-zu-de-min-zu-xing-zhi-hua-xia-xue-mai-yu-zhong-hua-wen-hua-de-wu-qian-nian-chuan-cheng/><link rel=alternate hreflang=es href=/es/han-zu-de-min-zu-xing-zhi-hua-xia-xue-mai-yu-zhong-hua-wen-hua-de-wu-qian-nian-chuan-cheng/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51);color-scheme:dark}.list{background:var(--theme)}.toc{background:var(--entry)}}@media(prefers-color-scheme:light){.list::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--code-bg)}}</style></noscript><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="dark":localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="light":window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches?document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="dark":document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="light"</script><script>(function(){var t,n,s,o="pref-theme",e=localStorage.getItem(o);if(e==="dark"||e==="light"){document.documentElement.classList.toggle("dark",e==="dark");return}t=(new Date).getHours(),n=t>=19||t<7,s=n,document.documentElement.classList.toggle("dark",s)})()</script><script>(function(){function e(e){localStorage.setItem("pref-theme",e),document.documentElement.classList.toggle("dark",e==="dark")}document.addEventListener("click",function(t){var n=t.target,s=n&&(n.id==="moon"?n:n.closest&&n.closest("#moon")),o=n&&(n.id==="sun"?n:n.closest&&n.closest("#sun"));s&&e("dark"),o&&e("light")})})()</script><style>.post-content img,.post-single img,article img{display:block;height:auto;width:min(100%,800px);margin:1rem auto;cursor:zoom-in}.hd-lightbox{position:fixed;inset:0;background:rgba(0,0,0,.85);display:none;align-items:center;justify-content:center;z-index:9999;padding:24px}.hd-lightbox.open{display:flex}.hd-lightbox img{max-width:min(96vw,1400px);max-height:92vh;width:auto;height:auto;cursor:zoom-out;border-radius:8px}.hd-lightbox .hint{position:fixed;top:12px;right:14px;font-size:12px;opacity:.75}</style><script>(function(){function e(e){document.readyState!=="loading"?e():document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",e)}e(function(){var t,e=document.createElement("div");e.className="hd-lightbox",e.innerHTML='<div class="hint">Click image / Press ESC to close</div><img alt=""/>',document.body.appendChild(e),t=e.querySelector("img");function n(){e.classList.remove("open"),t.src=""}e.addEventListener("click",n),document.addEventListener("keydown",function(e){e.key==="Escape"&&n()});function s(){var n=document.querySelectorAll(".post-content img, .post-single img, article img");n.forEach(function(n){if(n.dataset.hdBound)return;if(n.dataset.hdBound="1",n.naturalWidth&&n.naturalWidth<80||n.width&&n.width<80)return;n.addEventListener("click",function(s){s.preventDefault(),s.stopPropagation();var o=n.currentSrc||n.src;if(!o)return;t.src=o,e.classList.add("open")})})}s()})})()</script><meta property="og:url" content="/en/han-zu-de-min-zu-xing-zhi-hua-xia-xue-mai-yu-zhong-hua-wen-hua-de-wu-qian-nian-chuan-cheng/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="zixia"><meta property="og:title" content="The Ethnic Nature of the Han People: 5,000 Years of Huaxia Bloodline and Chinese Culture"><meta property="og:description" content="1.

Ultimately, the people of the Yan Emperor and Chiyou were incorporated into the Yellow Emperor’s tribe, forming the “Huaxia.”\n👉 From the very beginning, the Chinese nation has been a civilizational community that was diverse and coexistent, eventually tending towards unity.\n2. The Origin of “Hua”: Flower and Mount Hua In ancient Chinese, “华” (Huà) and “花” (huā, flower) had similar pronunciations. The flower, symbolizing prosperity, was likely a totem of an early tribe.\nMount Hua, revered as the Western Sacred Mountain, is considered the sacred mountain of the “Hua people.”\nBy the Spring and Autumn period, the Book of Documents (“Completion of the War”) already stated:\nThe Huaxia, Man, and Mo peoples, none failed to follow and submit.\nThe Zuo Zhuan (“10th Year of Duke Ding”) says:\nThe Yi people do not plot against Xia, the Yi barbarians do not disrupt Hua.\nThis indicates that “Huaxia” had already become the self-identity of the Central Plains civilization.\n👉 The tribal alliance of myth eventually transformed into a civilizational concept in written records.\n3. Evidence of the Xia: Yangshao, Longshan, Erlitou, and Liangzhu The Xia Dynasty was long considered a “legendary dynasty.”\nHowever, archaeological discoveries have gradually clarified history:\nYangshao Culture (c. 5000–3000 BCE, middle Yellow River): Characterized by painted pottery, it was primarily agricultural and formed the foundation of the early Huaxia people in the Central Plains. Longshan Culture (c. 3000–1900 BCE, lower Yellow River): The appearance of black pottery and city sites indicates increased social stratification and the initial formation of a state, a key stage leading to the Xia. Erlitou Culture (c. 1900–1500 BCE, Yanshi, Henan): With its palaces, roads, and bronze ritual vessels, it shows centralized power and is widely believed to be associated with the Xia Dynasty, marking the entry of Huaxia into the “era of the state.” Meanwhile, the Yangtze River basin developed in parallel:\nLiangzhu Culture (c. 3300–2300 BCE, Zhejiang): Known for its jade civilization, jade being a unique symbol of Chinese civilization. Its highly developed ritual system and social hierarchy have led it to be called “proof of 5,000 years of Chinese civilization.” Ancient DNA studies show that the paternal lineage of the Liangzhu people was also predominantly Haplogroup O (mostly O1, O2), closely related to the O-M122 of the Central Plains Han people. This suggests: The Liangzhu people were genetically related to the Central Plains population but developed a distinct southern civilization. 👉 Conclusion: The Yangshao-Longshan-Erlitou sequence represents the direct lineage of the Xia Dynasty, while Liangzhu represents the peak of southern civilization. These northern and southern streams developed in parallel and eventually converged, forming the diverse yet unified structure of Huaxia civilization.\n4. Ancient DNA and the Imprint of East Asian Paternal Lineages Ancient DNA research shows:\nThe populations of Yangshao, Longshan, and Erlitou have genetic continuity with modern Han, Tibetan, and Qiang peoples. Components of the Liangzhu culture’s population are still present in southern Han Chinese and Miao-Yi ethnic groups. Over 70% of modern Han Chinese men belong to the O haplogroup (especially O-M122), which is the core paternal marker of the Han ethnicity.\nPaternal Haplogroup Comparison of Major East Asian Ethnic Groups Han Chinese: 70–80% O, the most concentrated. Tibetans: 50–60% O, with another 35–45% D-M174 (a remnant of an ancient East Asian indigenous paternal lineage). Qiang: Predominantly O, continuing ancient Qiang characteristics. Mongols: Predominantly C-M217 (50–60%), a typical marker of nomadic peoples. Manchus: Historically similar to Mongols, with C as the main haplogroup. After entering China proper, long-term intermarriage with Han Chinese has led to a predominance of O today. Japanese: 40–50% O, 30–40% D-M174, with a small amount of C. Koreans: 60–70% O, with small amounts of C and N. European Comparison: Approx. 60–70% R (mainly R1b in Western Europe, R1a in Eastern Europe), plus I (10–20%), and smaller proportions of E/J/G. 👉 Conclusion: The Han O haplogroup is the most stable and concentrated. Tibetans and Japanese retain a large amount of the ancient D haplogroup. Mongols and Manchus were once dominated by C but eventually integrated into the larger O system.\n5. Han, Tibetan, and Qiang: Same Origin, Different Branches The Han, Tibetan, and Qiang peoples all originate from the ancient Qiang people:\nHan: One branch of the ancient Qiang moved into the Yellow River basin, developed agriculture, and merged with the Yangshao-Longshan-Erlitou cultures to form the Han people (70–80% O). Tibetans: Another branch of the ancient Qiang moved onto the Tibetan Plateau, engaged in pastoralism, and merged with the Paleolithic indigenous people carrying D-M174, forming the Tibetan people (O ≈50–60%, D ≈35–45%). Qiang: The Qiang people in today’s Mao County, Sichuan (who call themselves “Rma”), are direct descendants of the ancient Qiang. 👉 The Han, Tibetans, and Qiang are brotherly peoples from the same origin but different branches. The Han are the largest branch, while the Tibetans and Qiang retain more ancient genes and unique cultures.\n6. Genetic Drift: The High Probability of Minority Genes Disappearing Why has the Han O haplogroup persisted for thousands of years, while the genes of other ethnic groups have gradually dissipated?\nThe answer lies in genetic drift.\nGenetic drift refers to:\nMinority genes, having a very low frequency in a population, are susceptible to random fluctuations and are highly likely to disappear completely after a few generations. Majority genes are more stable and become more entrenched with each passing generation. It’s like gamblers in a casino:\nLarge capital (majority genes) can withstand occasional losses and continue playing. Small capital (minority genes) can be wiped out by a few fluctuations and eliminated from the game. Example from Human Evolution All humans today can be traced back to a single father, “Y-chromosomal Adam,” and a single mother, “Mitochondrial Eve.”\nThey were not the only people alive at the time, but:\nOther lineages were gradually absorbed or disappeared due to genetic drift. Only their lineages survived to become the common ancestors of modern humans. Meanwhile, other “human cousins” like the Neanderthals and Denisovans eventually went extinct.\n👉 The pattern is clear: in population fusion, minority genes disappear, and majority genes persist.\n7. Case Studies of Historical Peoples Turkic peoples: They once formed a powerful empire in Central Asia and were the ruling class of Turkey. However, the genes of modern Turkish people have almost no connection to East Asia. The Turkic bloodline has dissipated, leaving only the language. Xiongnu: They migrated west to Europe and established the “Hunnic Empire,” but modern Hungarians have almost no Xiongnu genes. Manchus: When they entered China proper during the Qing Dynasty, their paternal lineage was mostly C haplogroup. After three hundred years of integration, the paternal lineage of today’s Manchus is almost identical to that of the Han, predominantly O haplogroup. 👉 Historical facts confirm the principle of genetic drift: the genes of minority groups are eventually absorbed by the majority group.\n8. The “Uprising of the Five Barbarians” and the Misconception of Intermixing Many people claim that after the Uprising of the Five Barbarians, the Han people were thoroughly mixed.\nBut genetic testing shows the opposite:\nThe Han O haplogroup still accounts for 70–80%, making it the most stable genetic structure in East Asia. Other components (C, N, etc.) are present in very low proportions, far from enough to alter the main body. Historically, ethnic minorities were ultimately assimilated by the Han, not the other way around. 👉 The truth is: The Han were not diluted; rather, they continuously absorbed others as the main body.\nThis is why today’s Han people still maintain a high stability of the O haplogroup.\n9. Religious Culture: Rationality and Inclusiveness Han culture, like its genetics, exhibits a pattern of “stability + absorption.”\nShang Dynasty: Reverence for ghosts and emphasis on sacrifice. Zhou Dynasty: The Duke of Zhou established rites, with ancestor worship at the core. Confucianism: Respect ghosts and spirits but keep them at a distance; focus on human ethics and ritual governance. Han and Tang Dynasties: Buddhism, Daoism, and Confucianism coexisted. Song, Ming, and Qing Dynasties: Clan ancestral halls became deeply rooted at the grassroots level. Characteristics:\nAncestor Worship → A combination of bloodline and culture. Rationalization → Religion incorporated into the ritual system. Inclusiveness → Capable of absorbing foreign religions. Secularism → Readily accepts science and practicality. 👉 The stability of the genes and the rational inclusiveness of the culture mirror each other perfectly.\n10. The True Meaning of the Zhonghua Minzu (Chinese Nation) Linguistics: Chinese, Tibetan, Qiang, and Yi languages → all belong to the Sino-Tibetan language family. Genetics: The Han, Tibetan, and Qiang peoples share the O haplogroup from the ancient Qiang, just having taken different paths. History and Culture: The Yan Emperor, Yellow Emperor, Chiyou, and Qiang people → all were eventually incorporated into the Huaxia civilization. 👉 Zhonghua Minzu = The Han people as the main body + a community of multiple ethnic minorities.\n11. Conclusion From myth to archaeology, from genetics to culture, the Han people exhibit a “threefold continuity”:\nUnbroken Historical Culture — 5,000 years of Huaxia, an uninterrupted cultural lineage. Stable Genetic Bloodline — The Han O haplogroup as the backbone, with Tibetans and Qiang from the same origin. Inclusive and Rational Culture — Foreign religions and cultures were all integrated. The cultural and genetic inheritance of the Han people has a distinct ethnic character.\nHistorical culture and genetic tracing both prove that:\nThe Han people are the main body of the Zhonghua Minzu, and the Zhonghua Minzu is the civilizational community of China’s multi-ethnic peoples.\nOnly by examining genetics and history can we understand the origins of the Chinese nation.\n","wordCount":"1700","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","dateModified":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"/en/han-zu-de-min-zu-xing-zhi-hua-xia-xue-mai-yu-zhong-hua-wen-hua-de-wu-qian-nian-chuan-cheng/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"zixia","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=/en/ accesskey=h title="zixia (Alt + H)">zixia</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
