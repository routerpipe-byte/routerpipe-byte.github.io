The Yellow Emperor defeated the Yan Emperor at the Battle of Banquan, leading to the submission of the Yan tribe;
He then defeated Chiyou at the Battle of Zhuolu, ultimately emerging victorious.

This is not merely a legend but a symbol of the integration of ancient tribes:

The Yellow Emperor&rsquo;s group: An agricultural tribe from the Central Plains, with the surname Ji;
The Yan Emperor&rsquo;s group: A tribe with the surname Jiang, related to the ancient Qiang people;
Chiyou&rsquo;s group: The Jiuli tribe, ancestors of the Miao-Man peoples of the south.

Ultimately, the people of the Yan Emperor and Chiyou were incorporated into the Yellow Emperor’s tribe, forming the “Huaxia.”\n👉 From the very beginning, the Chinese nation was a civilizational community where diverse groups coexisted and eventually unified.\nII. The Origin of “Hua”: Flower and Mount Hua “Hua” (华) and “hua” (花, flower) were homophones in ancient Chinese. The flower symbolizes prosperity and was likely a totem of early tribes.\nMount Hua, revered as the Western Sacred Mountain, is the holy mountain of the “Hua people.”\nDuring the Spring and Autumn period, the Book of Documents · Wucheng already stated:\nThe Huaxia and the Man-Mo barbarians, there were none who did not follow and submit\nThe Zuo Zhuan · 10th Year of Duke Ding says:\nDescendants from afar should not plot against the Xia; barbarians should not disrupt the Hua\nThis shows that “Huaxia” had already become the self-identity of the Central Plains civilization.\n👉 The mythical tribal alliance eventually transformed into a civilizational concept in written records.\nIII. Evidence of the Xia: Yangshao, Longshan, Erlitou, and Liangzhu The Xia Dynasty was long considered a “legendary dynasty.”\nBut archaeological discoveries have gradually clarified history:\nYangshao Culture (c. 5000–3000 BCE, middle Yellow River): Best known for its painted pottery, it was primarily agricultural and formed the foundation of the early Huaxia groups in the Central Plains. Longshan Culture (c. 3000–1900 BCE, lower Yellow River): Characterized by black pottery and the emergence of city sites, it saw increased social stratification and the initial form of a state, marking a key stage leading to the Xia. Erlitou Culture (c. 1900–1500 BCE, Yanshi, Henan): With its palaces, roads, and bronze ritual vessels, it shows centralized power and is widely believed to be associated with the Xia Dynasty, marking the entry of Huaxia into the “state era.” Meanwhile, the Yangtze River basin developed in parallel:\nLiangzhu Culture (c. 3300–2300 BCE, Zhejiang): Known for its jade civilization, jade is a unique symbol of Chinese civilization. Its ritual system and social stratification were highly developed, earning it the title “material evidence of 5,000 years of Chinese civilization.” Ancient DNA studies show that the patrilineal lineage of the Liangzhu people was also dominated by Haplogroup O (mostly O1, O2), closely related to the O-M122 of the Central Plains Han people. This indicates that the Liangzhu people shared a common genetic origin with the people of the Central Plains, but they followed a southern path of civilization. 👉 Conclusion: The Yangshao-Longshan-Erlitou sequence represents the direct lineage of the Xia Dynasty, while Liangzhu represents the peak of southern civilization. The parallel development and eventual convergence of the north and south formed the pluralistic yet unified structure of Huaxia civilization.\nIV. Ancient DNA and the Patrilineal Imprint of East Asia Ancient DNA studies show:\nThe Yangshao-Longshan-Erlitou populations show genetic continuity with modern Han, Tibetan, and Qiang peoples. Components of the Liangzhu culture population are still present in southern Han Chinese and Miao-Yi ethnic groups. Over 70% of modern Han Chinese men belong to Haplogroup O (especially O-M122), which is the core patrilineal marker of the Han ethnicity.\nPatrilineal Comparison of Major East Asian Ethnic Groups Han Chinese: 70–80% Haplogroup O, the most concentrated. Tibetans: 50–60% Haplogroup O, with another 35–45% being D-M174 (a remnant of an ancient East Asian indigenous patrilineage). Qiang: Primarily Haplogroup O, continuing the characteristics of the ancient Qiang people. Mongols: Primarily C-M217 (50–60%), a typical marker of nomadic peoples. Manchu: Historically similar to Mongols, with C as the main haplogroup; after entering the Central Plains, long-term intermarriage with Han Chinese has led to O being the dominant haplogroup today. Japanese: 40–50% Haplogroup O, 30–40% D-M174, with a small amount of C. Koreans: 60–70% Haplogroup O, with small amounts of C and N. European Comparison: About 60–70% Haplogroup R (mainly R1b in Western Europe, R1a in Eastern Europe), with Haplogroup I (10–20%) and smaller proportions of E/J/G, etc. 👉 Conclusion: The Han Chinese Haplogroup O is the most stable and concentrated. Tibetans and Japanese retain a significant amount of the ancient D haplogroup. Mongols and Manchus were once dominated by C but eventually integrated into the larger O system.\nV. Han, Tibetan, and Qiang: Same Origin, Different Branches The Han, Tibetans, and Qiang all originate from the ancient Qiang people:\nHan: One branch of the ancient Qiang entered the Yellow River basin, developed agriculture, and merged with the Yangshao-Longshan-Erlitou cultures to form the Han people (70–80% Haplogroup O). Tibetans: Another branch of the ancient Qiang moved onto the Tibetan Plateau, engaged in pastoralism, and merged with the Paleolithic indigenous population carrying D-M174 to form the Tibetan people (O ≈50–60%, D ≈35–45%). Qiang: The Qiang people in today’s Maoxian area of Sichuan (who call themselves “Rma”) are direct descendants of the ancient Qiang. 👉 The Han, Tibetans, and Qiang are brotherly peoples from the same origin but different branches: the Han are the largest branch, while the Tibetans and Qiang retain more ancient genes and unique cultures.\nVI. Genetic Drift: The High Probability of Minority Genes Disappearing Why has the Han Haplogroup O persisted for thousands of years, while the genes of other ethnic groups have gradually dissipated?\nThe answer lies in genetic drift.\nGenetic drift refers to:\nMinority genes, having a very low proportion in a population, are susceptible to random fluctuations and are highly likely to disappear completely after a few generations. Majority genes, on the other hand, are more stable and become more entrenched with each passing generation. It’s like gamblers in a casino:\nLarge capital (majority genes), can withstand occasional losses and continue playing. Small capital (minority genes), can be wiped out and eliminated by just a few fluctuations. An Example from Human Evolution All humans today can be traced back to a single father, “Y-chromosomal Adam,” and a single mother, “Mitochondrial Eve.”\nThey were not the only people alive at the time, but:\nOther lineages were gradually absorbed or disappeared due to genetic drift. Only their lineages survived to become the common ancestors of all modern humans. Meanwhile, “Homo sapiens’ cousins” like the Neanderthals and Denisovans eventually went extinct.\n👉 The pattern is clear: in ethnic fusion, minority genes disappear, and majority genes persist.\nVII. Case Studies of Historical Peoples Turkic peoples: Once a powerful empire in Central Asia and the ruling class of Turkey, but the genes of modern Turkish people have almost no connection to East Asia. The Turkic bloodline has dissipated, leaving only the language. Xiongnu: Migrated west to Europe and established the “Hunnic Empire,” but modern Hungarians have almost no Hunnic genes. Manchu: When they entered the Central Plains during the Qing Dynasty, their patrilineage was mostly Haplogroup C. After three hundred years of integration, the patrilineage of modern Manchu people is almost identical to that of the Han, primarily Haplogroup O. 👉 Historical facts confirm the principle of genetic drift: the genes of minority groups are ultimately absorbed by the majority group.\nVIII. The “Uprising of the Five Barbarians” and the Misconception of Admixture Many people say: After the “Uprising of the Five Barbarians,” the Han people were thoroughly mixed.\nBut the facts from genetic testing show the opposite:\nHaplogroup O still accounts for 70–80% of the Han population, making it the most stable genetic structure in East Asia. Other components (C, N, etc.) are present in very low proportions, far from enough to alter the main body. Historically, minority ethnic groups were ultimately assimilated by the Han, not the other way around. 👉 The truth is: The Han were not diluted; they continuously absorbed others.\nThis is why the Han people today still maintain a high stability of Haplogroup O.\nIX. Religious Culture: Rationality and Inclusiveness Han culture, like its genetics, exhibits “stability + absorption.”\nShang Dynasty: Reverence for spirits and emphasis on sacrifice. Zhou Dynasty: The Duke of Zhou established rites, with ancestor worship at the core. Confucianism: “Respect ghosts and gods, but keep them at a distance,” focusing on human ethics and ritual governance. Han and Tang Dynasties: Buddhism, Daoism, and Confucianism coexisted. Song, Ming, and Qing Dynasties: Clan ancestral halls became deeply rooted at the grassroots level. Characteristics:\nAncestor Worship → The fusion of bloodline and culture. Rationalization → Religion incorporated into the ritual system. Inclusiveness → Ability to absorb foreign religions. Secularism → Openness to science and practical matters. 👉 The stability of genes and the rational inclusiveness of culture mirror each other.\nX. The True Meaning of the Chinese Nation Linguistics: Chinese, Tibetan, Qiang, and Yi languages → all belong to the Sino-Tibetan language family. Genetics: Han, Tibetan, and Qiang peoples share Haplogroup O from the ancient Qiang, just with different evolutionary paths. History and Culture: The Yan Emperor, Yellow Emperor, Chiyou, and Qiang people → all were eventually incorporated into the Huaxia civilization. 👉 The Chinese Nation (Zhonghua Minzu) = The Han as the main body + a community of multiple ethnic minorities.\nXI. Conclusion From myth to archaeology, from genetics to culture, the Han people exhibit a “threefold continuity”:\nUnbroken Historical Culture — 5,000 years of Huaxia, an uninterrupted cultural lineage. Stable Bloodline and Genes — Haplogroup O as the Han backbone, with a common origin for Tibetans and Qiang. Inclusive and Rational Culture — Foreign religions and cultures are all integrated. The cultural and bloodline inheritance of the Han people has a distinct ethnic character.\nHistorical culture and genetic tracing both prove:\nThe Han are the main body of the Chinese Nation (Zhonghua Minzu), and the Chinese Nation is a civilizational community of China’s multiple ethnic groups.\nOnly by examining genetics and history can we understand the origin of the Chinese Nation.\n","wordCount":"1715","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","dateModified":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"/en/han-zu-de-min-zu-xing-zhi-hua-xia-xue-mai-yu-zhong-hua-wen-hua-de-wu-qian-nian-chuan-cheng/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"zixia","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=/en/ accesskey=h title="zixia (Alt + H)">zixia</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">

Genetic Drift: The High Probability of Minority Genes Disappearing<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#vi-genetic-drift-the-high-probability-of-minority-genes-disappearing>#</a></h2><p>Why has the Han Haplogroup O persisted for thousands of years, while the genes of other ethnic groups have gradually dissipated?</p><p>The answer lies in <strong>genetic drift</strong>.</p><p>Genetic drift refers to:</p><ul><li>Minority genes, having a very low proportion in a population, are susceptible to random fluctuations and are highly likely to disappear completely after a few generations.</li><li>Majority genes, on the other hand, are more stable and become more entrenched with each passing generation.</li></ul><p>It&rsquo;s like gamblers in a casino:</p><ul><li><strong>Large capital</strong> (majority genes), can withstand occasional losses and continue playing.</li><li><strong>Small capital</strong> (minority genes), can be wiped out and eliminated by just a few fluctuations.</li></ul><h3 id=an-example-from-human-evolution>An Example from Human Evolution<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#an-example-from-human-evolution>#</a></h3><p>All humans today can be traced back to a single father, &ldquo;<strong>Y-chromosomal Adam</strong>,&rdquo; and a single mother, &ldquo;<strong>Mitochondrial Eve</strong>.&rdquo;</p><p>They were not the only people alive at the time, but:</p><ul><li>Other lineages were gradually absorbed or disappeared due to genetic drift.</li><li>Only their lineages survived to become the common ancestors of all modern humans.</li></ul><p>Meanwhile, &ldquo;Homo sapiens&rsquo; cousins&rdquo; like the Neanderthals and Denisovans eventually went extinct.</p><p>👉 The pattern is clear: in ethnic fusion, minority genes disappear, and majority genes persist.</p><hr><h2 id=vii-case-studies-of-historical-peoples>VII. Case Studies of Historical Peoples<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#vii-case-studies-of-historical-peoples>#</a></h2><ul><li><strong>Turkic peoples</strong>: Once a powerful empire in Central Asia and the ruling class of Turkey, but the genes of modern Turkish people have almost no connection to East Asia. The Turkic bloodline has dissipated, leaving only the language.</li><li><strong>Xiongnu</strong>: Migrated west to Europe and established the &ldquo;Hunnic Empire,&rdquo; but modern Hungarians have almost no Hunnic genes.</li><li><strong>Manchu</strong>: When they entered the Central Plains during the Qing Dynasty, their patrilineage was mostly Haplogroup C. After three hundred years of integration, the patrilineage of modern Manchu people is almost identical to that of the Han, primarily Haplogroup O.</li></ul><p>👉 Historical facts confirm the principle of genetic drift: the genes of minority groups are ultimately absorbed by the majority group.</p><hr><h2 id=viii-the-uprising-of-the-five-barbarians-and-the-misconception-of-admixture>VIII.

Conclusion<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#xi-conclusion>#</a></h2><p>From myth to archaeology, from genetics to culture, the Han people exhibit a &ldquo;<strong>threefold continuity</strong>&rdquo;:</p><ol><li><strong>Unbroken Historical Culture</strong> — 5,000 years of Huaxia, an uninterrupted cultural lineage.</li><li><strong>Stable Bloodline and Genes</strong> — Haplogroup O as the Han backbone, with a common origin for Tibetans and Qiang.</li><li><strong>Inclusive and Rational Culture</strong> — Foreign religions and cultures are all integrated.</li></ol><blockquote><p>The cultural and bloodline inheritance of the Han people has a distinct ethnic character.</p><p>Historical culture and genetic tracing both prove:</p><p>The Han are the main body of the Chinese Nation (Zhonghua Minzu), and the Chinese Nation is a civilizational community of China&rsquo;s multiple ethnic groups.</p><p>Only by examining genetics and history can we understand the origin of the Chinese Nation.</p></blockquote></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul></footer></article></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2026 <a href=/en/>zixia</a></span> ·
