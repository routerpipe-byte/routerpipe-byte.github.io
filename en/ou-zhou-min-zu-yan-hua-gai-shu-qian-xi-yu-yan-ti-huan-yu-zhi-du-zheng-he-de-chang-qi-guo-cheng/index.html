Bronze Age: Indo-European Steppe Peoples Enter Europe (c. 3000 BC)\nOrigin Pontic-Caspian Steppe (peoples related to the Yamnaya culture)\nPaternal Haplogroup Characteristics R1a, R1b\nElements Introduced\nHorses and chariots Military aristocratic structure Patrilineal inheritance system Indo-European languages Result\nSignificant replacement of the male-dominant stratum in most of Europe The European language system as a whole shifted to Indo-European III. Language Replacement: The Separation of Civilizational Structure and Linguistic Origin The urban structure, institutions, and cultural traditions of Greek and Roman civilizations continued the Neolithic civilizational foundation of the Mediterranean-Near East, which was primarily established by early agricultural peoples.\nHowever, their language systems were:\nGreek → Indo-European Latin → Indo-European Concluding Fact Early agricultural peoples laid the foundation for civilization and urban structures, but under the subsequent military and political system dominated by Indo-European steppe peoples, a systemic Indo-Europeanization occurred at the linguistic level.\nIV. Iron Age: The Celts Dominate Western Europe (c. 800 BC–100 BC)\nPaternal Haplogroup Characteristics Primarily R1b\nLanguage Indo-European · Celtic branch\nDistribution Area\nGaul (modern France) The British Isles Belgium Northern Italy Northern Iberian Peninsula Social Form Tribal confederation structure; did not form a unified empire.\nV. Roman Period: Latinization and Integration (c. 100 BC–400 AD)\nRoman Republic → Roman Empire Latin became the lingua franca of Western Europe Local Celts and other groups were culturally and linguistically Latinized Characteristics Rome’s integration was primarily based on institutions, law, and culture, without conducting large-scale, systematic population replacement.\nVI. The Rise of the Germanic Peoples (3rd–6th Centuries AD)\nEthnic Characteristics The Germanic peoples also belong to the Indo-European system, with paternal haplogroups being predominantly R1, mixed with some original Northern European I-haplogroup components.\nMain Branches\nOstrogoths Visigoths Franks Anglo-Saxons Norse Vikings Key Event\n476 AD: Germanic mercenaries depose the Western Roman Emperor Fall of the Western Roman Empire Subsequently, Western Europe gradually formed a political structure with the Germanic nobility as the secular ruling core and the Church as the spiritual authority, eventually developing into the Holy Roman Empire system.\nVII. The Ethnic and Linguistic Formation of England (Timeline) 410 AD: Roman legions withdraw from Britain\nMid-5th Century (c. 450 AD onwards): Angles, Saxons, and Jutes enter Britain\nResult\nThe Celts are pushed to Scotland, Wales, and Ireland Language: English (Germanic language family) Ethnic Structure: Germanic majority + Celtic periphery VIII. The Ethnic and Linguistic Formation of France (Timeline) 1st Century BC: Caesar conquers Gaul\n5th Century AD: The Franks enter Gaul\nc. 481 AD: Clovis I establishes the Frankish Kingdom\nResult\nRuling Class: Germanic (Franks) Population Majority: Latinized Celts Language: Evolution of Vulgar Latin → French (Romance language family) IX. Spain and Italy Spain 5th–8th Centuries: Visigothic rule\n711–1492: Muslim rule in Iberia\nPopulation Composition\nNative Iberians Romans Germanic peoples North Africans Language Spanish (Romance, derived from Latin)\nItaly Core area of Roman civilization Population continuity is relatively high in Europe Language Italian (Romance language family) X. Overview of European Regional Ethnic Structures Northern Europe: Germanic peoples (Germany, Austria, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Iceland) Western Europe: Germanic ruling class + Latin cultural majority Southern Europe: Latino-Greek civilizational system Eastern Europe: Primarily Slavic, with Turkic and Balkan admixtures XI. The Unifying Role of Religion After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the only organization that maintained a complete, trans-regional structure was the Catholic Church.\nLatin became the trans-ethnic language of religion and scholarship The Pope held the authority to legitimize royal power The religious network connected European countries and royal families, forming a supra-national integration structure. XII. Royal Marriages and Supra-National Rule Represented by the House of Habsburg:\nRuled multiple countries through royal marriages Royal lineage often did not align with the local ethnic majority The concept of the nation-state primarily formed in the modern era.\nXIII. Concluding Facts Approximately 50%–60% of European paternal haplogroups belong to the R1 haplogroup Ethnic divisions are not determined by lineage alone Instead, they are shaped by a combination of the following factors:\nLanguage Historical memory Cultural traditions Political and religious structures Appendix I: Timeline of European Ethnogenesis Time Event Main Population Key Change 7000–5000 BC Neolithic agricultural diffusion J haplogroup (represented by J2) Agriculture, settlement, city prototypes 3000 BC Indo-European steppe peoples enter R1a / R1b Military aristocracy, Indo-European languages 800–100 BC Celts dominate Western Europe R1b Main population of Western Europe 100 BC Roman conquest of Gaul Romans + Celts Latinization 3rd–6th c.
