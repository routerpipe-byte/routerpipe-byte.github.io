In Which Cases Must a “Collective Address Certificate” Be Submitted? _A Certificado colectivo must be submitted in the following scenarios:\n✔️ Residence permit renewal for minors (The immigration office explicitly requires a colectivo certificate)\n✔️ School registration (new or transfer) School districts are determined based on the family’s address.\n✔️ Health card (SIP) application or changing health centers To confirm the assigned health district.\n✔️ Subsidy applications Such as childcare benefits, family subsidies, etc.\n🧾 II. Required Documents (Applicable throughout Spain) The following documents are generally required by all Ayuntamientos (city halls):\n1. Identification of both parents (DNI/NIE/TIE) ✔️ Because both parents are the interesados (interested parties) in the application.\n2. Identification of the minor child (Passport / NIE / TIE) ✔️ The child cannot sign, but their identification must be provided.\n3. Authorization Form (MOD_AUT_PROGENITORS) ✔️ Parents authorize the submission of the application (the child does not need to sign).\n4. Main Application Form (MOD_SOL_AUT_CERT_COL) ✔️ To fill in the family’s address and member information.\n5. Proof of Residence (Contract/Bill) Some city halls may require this; it is recommended to have it ready.\n🧭 III. Accessing the Application Portal (Applicable Nationwide) The path is almost always the same:\nSede Electrónica → Catálogo de trámites → Certificado de empadronamiento colectivo\nThe interface may vary slightly between cities, but the process is the same.\n📝 IV. How to Correctly Fill in the Interested Parties (Interesados) —This is the key to a successful process! ✔️ 1. You must include both parents (the two adults) Reasons:\nBoth are adults registered at the address The system requires all “interesados” to sign Legally, both parents have custody This is the fastest for review and the most recognized method by the immigration office ❌ 2. Do not add the minor The child cannot sign electronically. If you add them:\nThe system will ask for the child’s signature The process will get stuck at “Pendiente de firma” (Awaiting signature) You will have to reapply The correct way is: 👉 Upload the child’s identification, but do not add the child as an interesado.\n📎 V. Uploading Documents (Envío de documentos) Document Purpose Required MOD_SOL_AUT_CERT_COL Main application form ✔️ Identification of both parents To verify the identity of the adult interested parties ✔️ Child’s identification (Passport/NIE/TIE) To verify the minor’s information ✔️ MOD_AUT_PROGENITORS Parental authorization document ✔️ Contract/Bill Supporting proof Optional Once completed, click Siguiente.\n✍️ VI. Electronic Signature (Firma) —Both parents must complete the signature separately Go to:\nPaso 5 – Firma\n✔️ Step 1: One parent signs first Select your digital certificate:\nCertificado digital de persona física de [Name]\nClick Firmar → The system will display:\nInstancia firmada correctamente\n✔️ Step 2: The other parent must also sign (this cannot be skipped) Two methods to switch digital certificates:\n🔧 Method A: Close the browser → Log in again with the other person’s certificate to sign Close all browser windows Reopen it Go to Consulta de sus trámites Click Firma Use the other parent’s digital certificate → Signature complete 🧩 Method B (Recommended): Chrome Multiple Profiles The most stable method, avoids conflicts:\nIn Chrome, top right corner → “Add” Create a browser profile for the second parent Open the city hall website in the new profile Go to Firma → Complete the second signature ⏳ VII. Processing Time: Generally 1-3 business days to receive the certificate After successful submission, the city hall’s review speed is typically:\n✔️ Normal: 24–72 hours (1–3 business days) This is the speed in places like L’Eliana, Valencia, Madrid, etc.\n✔️ Peak Season: 3–5 days (e.g., before school starts in September) 📬 How to Receive the Result Method 1: Email Notification It will be sent to the email address (Correo electrónico) provided by the applicant. It may come with a PDF attached or provide a download link.\nMethod 2: Online Download Go to:\nConsulta de sus trámites → Carpeta ciudadana → Descargar\nThe PDF file will contain:\nAll family members (including minors) Address Registration and issuance dates City hall’s electronic seal It is generally valid for 90 days.\n🧷 VIII. Special Instructions for Residence Permit Renewal (Renovación) If you are renewing a residence permit for a minor:\n✔️ You must submit a collective address certificate (colectivo) ✔️ You must upload the child’s identification ✔️ Both parents must complete the electronic signature These are strict requirements from the immigration office.\n🎯 IX. Summary (The 3 Most Important Points) 1️⃣ For interesados, only list both parents, not the minor 2️⃣ Both parents must sign separately using their own digital certificates 3️⃣ Since the child does not have a digital certificate, the only way to get their address certificate online is through the “collective address certificate” method\nTherefore:\n🟢 Adults can get their certificate “instantly” online 🟢 Minors must use the method described in this article to apply online 🟢 You can get the PDF file in 1-3 business days without visiting the city hall This is currently the most time-saving, effective, and standardized method available nationwide in Spain.\nSpain’s e-government services are quite comprehensive; things like fishing licenses, address certificates, address updates, tax payments, digital certificate renewals, traffic fines, and administrative penalty appeals can all be handled online.\n","wordCount":"1047","inLanguage":"zh","datePublished":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","dateModified":"2026-02-04T11:20:36Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"/en/how-to-apply-for-a-collective-address-certificate-for-minors-online/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"zixia","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=/zh/ accesskey=h title="zixia (Alt + H)">zixia</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
