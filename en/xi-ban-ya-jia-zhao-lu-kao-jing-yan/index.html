&ldquo;title&rdquo;: &ldquo;My Experience Passing the Spanish Driving Road Test&rdquo;,
&ldquo;body&rdquo;: &ldquo;I passed my road test, and I&rsquo;m here to share my experience.\n\nDuring the driving road test in Spain, the examiner will only give instructions in Spanish, and the instructor is generally not allowed to translate. Therefore, it&rsquo;s crucial to master the following common commands and their Spanish expressions:\n\n*   Start the engine: Arrancar\n*   Turn right: Derecha\n*   Turn left: Izquierda\n*   Go straight: Recto\n*   Make a U-turn: Cambio de sentido\n*   Indirect left turn: izquierda indirecto\n*   Roundabout: Rotonda\n*   First exit: Primera salida\n*   Second exit: Segunda salida\n*   Third exit: Tercera salida\n*   Fourth exit: Cuarta salida\n*   Stop: Parar\n*   Park: Aparcar\n\nIf you don&rsquo;t hear an instruction clearly, you can ask the examiner to repeat it in Spanish, for example: “Por favor repita”.\n\n### Be Aware of Deviations in Examiner Instructions\n\nSometimes the examiner might give an incorrect instruction, either intentionally or unintentionally. For example, if they tell you to turn right but there&rsquo;s a sign prohibiting it, you should ignore the instruction and follow the road signs.\n\nAlso, maintain a wide field of vision while driving. Be aware that road markings are often about 30 meters before an intersection, and there might not be a corresponding sign at the intersection itself. Pay attention to vertical signs and traffic lights, with traffic lights having the highest priority. If there&rsquo;s a STOP sign at an intersection but the traffic light is green, you must follow the higher-priority traffic light and not stop.\n\n### Understanding Roundabout Rules\n\n*   Urban Roundabouts:\n    *   For left turns and U-turns, you must use the inner lane.\n    *   When the inner lane has a traffic light, you can proceed directly on green. A flashing yellow light means you must yield to traffic from the right. Be sure to look to your right; you must yield to cars that are 25 meters away because they are moving fast.\n    *   For right turns and going straight, you should use the outer lane.\n\n*   Interurban (Out-of-town) Roundabouts:\n    *   Always use the outer lane, unless you are overtaking, in which case you can use the inner lane.\n\nWhen exiting a roundabout, be sure to signal right in advance and use your turn signals correctly to help with lane changes. If traffic prevents you from changing from an inner lane to exit, continue circling the roundabout until it&rsquo;s safe to change lanes. Then, switch to the rightmost lane (the further right, the better) to exit (in Spain, consecutive lane changes are allowed). For complex roundabouts split into several islands, to make a left turn, you might enter from the rightmost lane, while going straight might require the middle or leftmost lane. The keyword for this is indirecto.\n\n### Lane Choice and Intersection Driving\n\n*   When Going Straight:\n    *   If there are three lanes, you should generally choose the first lane from the right (the rightmost lane).\n    *   If there are more than three lanes, it&rsquo;s recommended to use the second lane from the right.\n\n*   When Passing Through Intersections:\n    *   Avoid stopping on pedestrian crossings, bike lanes, or other special lanes, especially in congested areas marked with a cross-hatched grid (yellow box).\n    *   If the vehicle ahead stops due to lack of space, you should stop early and wait, ensuring your vehicle does not block these special lanes.\n\n### Safe Driving and Right-of-Way Awareness\n\nSpanish traffic laws are very strict about the right of way. People have a strong sense of it. On pedestrian crossings without traffic lights, pedestrians have absolute priority. They are not in the habit of looking both ways for traffic and may cross suddenly. Therefore, when driving in areas where you do not have the right of way, you must be highly alert, especially on sections with yield signs. You need to check for oncoming traffic in bike lanes or vehicle lanes behind you, and physically turn your head to confirm the situation.\n\nHowever, when you have a green light, you must not slow down or stop for pedestrians on a crosswalk, unless there is an unavoidable emergency, in which case only emergency braking is permitted. When approaching a crosswalk without a traffic light, you should slow down appropriately. If there are signs indicating students or children, you must perform a braking action to reduce speed.\n\nGenerally, the speed limit on urban roads is 50 km/h, while single-lane roads may be limited to 30 or 20 km/h. Outside the city, the limit is typically 90 km/h, and 120 km/h on highways. You are generally expected to drive as close to the speed limit as possible; going 2-5 km/h over the limit is usually acceptable.\n\n### STOP Signs and Temporary Stopping Requirements\n\nWhen you encounter a STOP line on the road, you must stop before the line for 3 seconds. Then, after moving forward about 1-2 meters past the line, you must stop again to check for traffic. This double stop is a test requirement. If visibility is poor, you should stop multiple times to ensure it&rsquo;s safe.\n\nHowever, note that if there is also a traffic light, you must strictly follow the light&rsquo;s signal. You are not allowed to stop at a green light; you must proceed directly. Stopping in this situation will result in points being deducted. If there is no stop line, you should position your car about one meter into the intersection, stop for at least 3 seconds, confirm it&rsquo;s safe, and then proceed.\n\n### Road Test Procedure and Driving Strategy\n\nThe road test usually begins with 3-5 minutes of free driving, after which the examiner will give specific instructions. Since you may not be familiar with many of the routes, it&rsquo;s advisable to look for road signs far in advance. For example, you might need to enter a roundabout from the left lane, while the right lane is for other directions; signs above the intersection usually indicate this. Sometimes, a left turn doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean using the left lane; you might need to make the turn from the right lane. In all such cases, you must observe the road markings or overhead signs ahead of time and prepare to change lanes. If it&rsquo;s too late to change lanes safely, it&rsquo;s better to disobey the examiner&rsquo;s instruction than to make a forced lane change.\n\nIf road markings are hard to see because they are blocked by a large vehicle or are faded, and there are no clear directional or prohibitive signs at the intersection, you can watch for hand signals from your instructor. When in doubt, it&rsquo;s advisable to turn right and avoid turning left if possible.\n\n

\n\n> Prioritize the traffic light on the right; do not stop for the STOP sign when the light is green.\n\n

\n\n> The road markings indicate a right turn only, but there is no sign at the intersection prohibiting a left turn. If a large vehicle is blocking the view, it&rsquo;s hard to see that you can&rsquo;t turn left.\n\n

Therefore, it’s crucial to master the following common commands and their Spanish expressions:\\n\\n* Start the engine: Arrancar\\n* Turn right: Derecha\\n* Turn left: Izquierda\\n* Go straight: Recto\\n* Make a U-turn: Cambio de sentido\\n* Indirect left turn: izquierda indirecto\\n* Roundabout: Rotonda\\n* First exit: Primera salida\\n* Second exit: Segunda salida\\n* Third exit: Tercera salida\\n* Fourth exit: Cuarta salida\\n* Stop: Parar\\n* Park: Aparcar\\n\\nIf you don’t hear an instruction clearly, you can ask the examiner to repeat it in Spanish, for example: “Por favor repita”.\\n\\n### Be Aware of Deviations in Examiner Instructions\\n\\nSometimes the examiner might give an incorrect instruction, either intentionally or unintentionally. For example, if they tell you to turn right but there’s a sign prohibiting it, you should ignore the instruction and follow the road signs.\\n\\nAlso, maintain a wide field of vision while driving. Be aware that road markings are often about 30 meters before an intersection, and there might not be a corresponding sign at the intersection itself. Pay attention to vertical signs and traffic lights, with traffic lights having the highest priority. If there’s a STOP sign at an intersection but the traffic light is green, you must follow the higher-priority traffic light and not stop.\\n\\n### Understanding Roundabout Rules\\n\\n* Urban Roundabouts:\\n * For left turns and U-turns, you must use the inner lane.\\n * When the inner lane has a traffic light, you can proceed directly on green. A flashing yellow light means you must yield to traffic from the right. Be sure to look to your right; you must yield to cars that are 25 meters away because they are moving fast.\\n * For right turns and going straight, you should use the outer lane.\\n\\n* Interurban (Out-of-town) Roundabouts:\\n * Always use the outer lane, unless you are overtaking, in which case you can use the inner lane.\\n\\nWhen exiting a roundabout, be sure to signal right in advance and use your turn signals correctly to help with lane changes. If traffic prevents you from changing from an inner lane to exit, continue circling the roundabout until it’s safe to change lanes. Then, switch to the rightmost lane (the further right, the better) to exit (in Spain, consecutive lane changes are allowed). For complex roundabouts split into several islands, to make a left turn, you might enter from the rightmost lane, while going straight might require the middle or leftmost lane. The keyword for this is indirecto.\\n\\n### Lane Choice and Intersection Driving\\n\\n* When Going Straight:\\n * If there are three lanes, you should generally choose the first lane from the right (the rightmost lane).\\n * If there are more than three lanes, it’s recommended to use the second lane from the right.\\n\\n* When Passing Through Intersections:\\n * Avoid stopping on pedestrian crossings, bike lanes, or other special lanes, especially in congested areas marked with a cross-hatched grid (yellow box).\\n * If the vehicle ahead stops due to lack of space, you should stop early and wait, ensuring your vehicle does not block these special lanes.\\n\\n### Safe Driving and Right-of-Way Awareness\\n\\nSpanish traffic laws are very strict about the right of way. People have a strong sense of it. On pedestrian crossings without traffic lights, pedestrians have absolute priority. They are not in the habit of looking both ways for traffic and may cross suddenly. Therefore, when driving in areas where you do not have the right of way, you must be highly alert, especially on sections with yield signs. You need to check for oncoming traffic in bike lanes or vehicle lanes behind you, and physically turn your head to confirm the situation.\\n\\nHowever, when you have a green light, you must not slow down or stop for pedestrians on a crosswalk, unless there is an unavoidable emergency, in which case only emergency braking is permitted. When approaching a crosswalk without a traffic light, you should slow down appropriately. If there are signs indicating students or children, you must perform a braking action to reduce speed.\\n\\nGenerally, the speed limit on urban roads is 50 km/h, while single-lane roads may be limited to 30 or 20 km/h. Outside the city, the limit is typically 90 km/h, and 120 km/h on highways. You are generally expected to drive as close to the speed limit as possible; going 2-5 km/h over the limit is usually acceptable.\\n\\n### STOP Signs and Temporary Stopping Requirements\\n\\nWhen you encounter a STOP line on the road, you must stop before the line for 3 seconds. Then, after moving forward about 1-2 meters past the line, you must stop again to check for traffic. This double stop is a test requirement. If visibility is poor, you should stop multiple times to ensure it’s safe.\\n\\nHowever, note that if there is also a traffic light, you must strictly follow the light’s signal. You are not allowed to stop at a green light; you must proceed directly. Stopping in this situation will result in points being deducted. If there is no stop line, you should position your car about one meter into the intersection, stop for at least 3 seconds, confirm it’s safe, and then proceed.\\n\\n### Road Test Procedure and Driving Strategy\\n\\nThe road test usually begins with 3-5 minutes of free driving, after which the examiner will give specific instructions. Since you may not be familiar with many of the routes, it’s advisable to look for road signs far in advance. For example, you might need to enter a roundabout from the left lane, while the right lane is for other directions; signs above the intersection usually indicate this. Sometimes, a left turn doesn’t necessarily mean using the left lane; you might need to make the turn from the right lane. In all such cases, you must observe the road markings or overhead signs ahead of time and prepare to change lanes. If it’s too late to change lanes safely, it’s better to disobey the examiner’s instruction than to make a forced lane change.\\n\\nIf road markings are hard to see because they are blocked by a large vehicle or are faded, and there are no clear directional or prohibitive signs at the intersection, you can watch for hand signals from your instructor.
