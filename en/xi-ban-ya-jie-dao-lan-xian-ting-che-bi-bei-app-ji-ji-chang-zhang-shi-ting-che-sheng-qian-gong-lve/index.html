&ldquo;title&rdquo;: &ldquo;Essential Apps for Blue Zone Street Parking in Spain & Money-Saving Tips for Long-Term Airport Parking&rdquo;,
&ldquo;body&rdquo;: &ldquo;In Spain, commercial parking lots are generally expensive. A few hours can easily cost tens of euros, which is a significant expense. To save money, you can opt for free roadside parking spots or the municipally provided blue zone paid parking spaces.\n\nBlue zone parking is cheaper, around €1 per hour, but manual payment is cumbersome. You need to find a nearby payment machine, enter your license plate number and parking duration, and pay with coins or a card. If you leave early, the refund process is also quite troublesome. Therefore, it&rsquo;s highly recommended to use convenient parking payment apps for online payment and flexible billing, which is more economical.\n\nAdditionally, taxi fares to Spanish airports are high. Traveling from a smaller city to Madrid&rsquo;s airport by train or bus is both troublesome and time-consuming. It would be much more convenient if you could park your own car near the airport and drive home directly upon your return. However, official airport parking is expensive, and long-term parking fees can be a major outlay. So, how can you save money? In fact, there are specialized long-term parking lots near Spanish airports, costing around €4 per day. This is the most cost-effective option for those traveling in groups.\n\n## 1. Essential Apps for Blue Zone Street Parking in Spain: Telpark & EasyPark\n\n### Telpark: The Top Choice for Local Residents\n\nTelpark is a widely used roadside parking payment app in Spain, covering blue zone parking spaces in most cities across the country and multiple public car parks.\n\nTelpark&rsquo;s Key Features:\n\n*   Mobile Payment: Pay online anytime, anywhere, no cash needed.\n*   Remote Renewal Reminders: Get automatic reminders before your parking expires, allowing you to extend your time and avoid fines.\n*   Parking Location Record: Automatically saves your parking location, making it easy to find your car.\n*   Convenient Bill Management: View and download your parking invoices at any time.\n\nTarget Audience: Daily city commuters.\n\nTypically, municipal parking spaces have a maximum stay of 2 hours.

&ldquo;title&rdquo;: &ldquo;Essential Apps for Blue Zone Street Parking in Spain & Money-Saving Tips for Long-Term Airport Parking&rdquo;,
&ldquo;body&rdquo;: &ldquo;In Spain, commercial parking lots are generally expensive. A few hours can easily cost tens of euros, which is a significant expense. To save money, you can opt for free roadside parking spots or the municipally provided blue zone paid parking spaces.\n\nBlue zone parking is cheaper, around €1 per hour, but manual payment is cumbersome. You need to find a nearby payment machine, enter your license plate number and parking duration, and pay with coins or a card. If you leave early, the refund process is also quite troublesome. Therefore, it&rsquo;s highly recommended to use convenient parking payment apps for online payment and flexible billing, which is more economical.\n\nAdditionally, taxi fares to Spanish airports are high. Traveling from a smaller city to Madrid&rsquo;s airport by train or bus is both troublesome and time-consuming. It would be much more convenient if you could park your own car near the airport and drive home directly upon your return. However, official airport parking is expensive, and long-term parking fees can be a major outlay. So, how can you save money? In fact, there are specialized long-term parking lots near Spanish airports, costing around €4 per day. This is the most cost-effective option for those traveling in groups.\n\n## 1.
