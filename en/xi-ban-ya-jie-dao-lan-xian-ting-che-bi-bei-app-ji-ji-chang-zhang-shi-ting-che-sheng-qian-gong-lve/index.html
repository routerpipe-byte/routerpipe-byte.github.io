&ldquo;title&rdquo;: &ldquo;Essential Apps for Blue Zone Parking in Spain and a Guide to Saving on Long-Term Airport Parking&rdquo;,
&ldquo;body&rdquo;: &ldquo;In Spain, commercial parking lots are generally expensive. A few hours can cost tens of euros, which is a significant expense. To save money, you can opt for free roadside parking spots or the paid blue zone parking spaces provided by the municipality.\n\nBlue zone parking is cheaper, around €1 per hour, but paying manually can be a hassle. You need to go to a nearby payment machine, enter your license plate number and parking duration, and pay with coins or a card. If you leave early, the refund process is also quite complicated. Therefore, it&rsquo;s highly recommended to use a convenient parking payment app for online payments and flexible billing, which is more economical.\n\nAdditionally, taxi fares to Spanish airports are high. Traveling from a smaller city to Madrid airport by plane, and then transferring by train or bus, can be troublesome and time-consuming. It&rsquo;s much more convenient if you can park your own car near the airport and drive home directly upon your return. However, official airport parking is expensive, and long-term parking fees can be a major expense. So, how can you save money? In fact, there are specialized long-term parking lots near Spanish airports, costing around €4 per day. This is the most cost-effective option, especially when traveling in a group.\n\n## 1. Essential Apps for Blue Zone Street Parking in Spain: Telpark & EasyPark\n\n### Telpark: The Top Choice for Local Residents\n\nTelpark is a widely used roadside parking payment app in Spain, covering blue zone parking spaces in most cities across the country and several public car parks.\n\nTelpark Features:\n\n*   Mobile Payment: Pay online anytime, anywhere, no cash needed.\n*   Remote Renewal Reminders: Get automatic reminders before your parking expires, allowing you to extend your time and avoid fines.\n*   Parking Location Log: Automatically saves your parking location, making it easy to find your car.\n*   Easy Bill Management: View and download your parking invoices at any time.\n\nTarget Users: Daily city commuters.\n\nMunicipal parking spaces usually have a maximum stay of 2 hours. If you need to stay longer, you can end the current session in the app and immediately start a new one.\n\n

&ldquo;title&rdquo;: &ldquo;Essential Apps for Blue Zone Parking in Spain and a Guide to Saving on Long-Term Airport Parking&rdquo;,
&ldquo;body&rdquo;: &ldquo;In Spain, commercial parking lots are generally expensive. A few hours can cost tens of euros, which is a significant expense. To save money, you can opt for free roadside parking spots or the paid blue zone parking spaces provided by the municipality.\n\nBlue zone parking is cheaper, around €1 per hour, but paying manually can be a hassle. You need to go to a nearby payment machine, enter your license plate number and parking duration, and pay with coins or a card. If you leave early, the refund process is also quite complicated. Therefore, it&rsquo;s highly recommended to use a convenient parking payment app for online payments and flexible billing, which is more economical.\n\nAdditionally, taxi fares to Spanish airports are high. Traveling from a smaller city to Madrid airport by plane, and then transferring by train or bus, can be troublesome and time-consuming. It&rsquo;s much more convenient if you can park your own car near the airport and drive home directly upon your return. However, official airport parking is expensive, and long-term parking fees can be a major expense. So, how can you save money? In fact, there are specialized long-term parking lots near Spanish airports, costing around €4 per day. This is the most cost-effective option, especially when traveling in a group.\n\n## 1.
